The Tribunal disagrees with the Appellant. \n\n The Appellant appealed two decisions.  \n\n The first decision was that he didn’t have enough insurable hours of work to \nestablish a claim for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.  \n\n The second decision was the Commission’s denial of his request to antedate \n(which means back date) his claim for benefits. \n\n I find that the Appellant hasn’t shown that he has worked enough hours to qualify \n\nfor benefits. \n\n I also find that the Appellant hasn’t shown that he had good cause for the delay \nin applying for benefits. In other words, the Appellant hasn’t given an explanation that \n\nthe law accepts. This means that the Appellant’s application can’t be treated as though \n\nit was made earlier.1 \n\nOverview \n The Appellant applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits on July 11, 2024. \n\n The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided that the \nAppellant hadn’t worked enough hours to qualify. The Appellant disagrees. \n\n The Appellant is also asking that the application be treated as though it was \nmade earlier, on July 16, 2023. The Canada Employment Insurance Commission \n(Commission) has already refused this request. \n\n I have to decide two issues. \n\n• Did the Appellant work enough hours to qualify for EI benefits? \n\n \n1 Section 10(4) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) uses the term “initial claim” when talking about \nan application. \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n• Can the Appellant’s application for benefits be treated as though it was made on \n\nJuly 16, 2023? \n\nIssue 1 - Has the Appellant worked enough hours to qualify for \nbenefits? \n\n The Commission says that the Appellant doesn’t have enough hours because he \n\nneeds 630 hours and only has 41 hours.  \n\n The Appellant disagrees and says that the Commission should have considered \nall the hours he had worked at his previous job. \n\nAnalysis \nHow to qualify for benefits \n\n Not everyone who stops work can receive EI benefits. You have to prove that \nyou qualify for benefits.2 The Claimant has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. \nThis means that he has to show that it is more likely than not that he qualifies for \nbenefits. \n\n To qualify, you need to have worked enough hours within a certain timeframe. \nThis timeframe is called the “qualifying period.”3 \n\n The number of hours depends on the unemployment rate in your region.4 \n\nThe Appellant’s region and regional rate of unemployment \n The Commission decided that the Claimant’s region was Toronto and that the \n\nregional rate of unemployment at the time was 7.7%.5 \n\n \n2 See section 48 of the EI Act. \n3 See section 7 of the EI Act. \n4 See section 7(2)(b) of the EI Act and section 17 of the Employment Insurance Regulations. \n5 See GD3-19 \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n This means that the Claimant would need to have worked at least 630 hours in \nhis qualifying period to qualify for EI benefits.6 \n\nThe Appellant agrees with the Commission \n The Claimant agrees with the Commission’s decisions about which region and \n\nregional rate of unemployment apply to him. \n\n There is no evidence that makes me doubt the Commission’s decision. So, I \n\naccept as fact that the Claimant needs to have worked 630 hours to qualify for benefits. \n\nThe Appellant’s qualifying period \n As noted above, the hours counted are the ones that the Claimant worked during \n\nhis qualifying period. In general, the qualifying period is the 52 weeks before your \nbenefit period would start.7 \n\n Your benefit period isn’t the same thing as your qualifying period. It is a \ndifferent timeframe. Your benefit period is the time when you can receive EI benefits. \n\n The Commission decided that the Claimant’s qualifying period was the usual \n\n52 weeks. It determined that the Claimant’s qualifying period went from July 9, 2023, to \n\nJuly 6, 2024. \n\nThe hours the Appellant worked \n The Commission decided that the Claimant had worked 41 hours during his \n\nqualifying period. \n\n The Claimant doesn’t dispute this. In his evidence the Appellant confirmed that \n\nhe hadn’t worked since losing his job on July 9, 2023. \n\n \n6 Section 7 of the EI Act sets out a chart that tells us the minimum number of hours that you need \ndepending on the different regional rates of unemployment. \n7 See section 8 of the EI Act. \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n However, the Appellant says they should have considered the hours he had \nworked at his previous job before July 9, 2023. \n\n Unfortunately, those hours worked were outside of his qualifying period. \n\n There is no evidence that makes me doubt the amount of hours worked in his \nqualifying period. So, I accept it as fact. \n\nHas the Appellant worked enough hours to qualify for EI benefits? \n I find that the Claimant hasn’t proven that he has enough hours to qualify for \n\nbenefits because he needs 630 hours but has worked 41 hours. The hours that the \nAppellant had worked at his previous job, other than the 41 hours mentioned above, \nwere outside of his qualifying period. \n\nIssue 2 – Can the Appellant’s application for benefits be treated as \nthough it was made on July 16, 2023? \n\n The Commission says that the Appellant didn’t have good cause for the delay in \napplying for benefits because he didn’t act like a reasonable person in his situation. \n\n They say that he didn’t take any steps to learn about his rights and obligations \n\nunder the Employment Insurance Act (Act) for almost a year. \n\n The Appellant disagrees and says that he acted as a reasonable person in the \ncircumstances.  \n\n He says that he had little or no experience in claiming EI benefits. \n\n He says that he thought benefits were only available for people who had been \nlaid-off from their jobs. 2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nAnalysis \n To get your application for benefits antedated, you have to prove these two \n\nthings:8 \n\na) You had good cause for the delay during the entire period of the delay. In \nother words, you have an explanation that the law accepts. \n\nb) You qualified for benefits on the earlier day (that is, the day you want your \napplication antedated to). \n\n The main arguments in this issue are about whether the Appellant had good \ncause. So, I will start with that. \n\n To show good cause, the Appellant has to prove that he acted as a reasonable \nand prudent person would have acted in similar circumstances.9 In other words, he has \nto show that he acted reasonably and carefully just as anyone else would have if they \nwere in a similar situation. \n\n The Appellant has to show that he acted this way for the entire period of the \ndelay.10 That period is from the day he wants his application antedated to until the day \nhe actually applied. So, for the Appellant, the period of the delay is from July 16, 2023, \nto July 9, 2024. \n\n The Appellant also has to show that he took reasonably prompt steps to \nunderstand his entitlement to benefits and obligations under the law.11 This means that \nthe Appellant has to show that he tried to learn about his rights and responsibilities as \nsoon as possible and as best he could. If the Appellant didn’t take these steps, then he \nmust show that there were exceptional circumstances that explain why he didn’t do so.12 \n\n \n8 See section 10(4) of the EI Act. \n9 See Canada (Attorney General) v Burke, 2012 FCA 139. \n10 See Canada (Attorney General) v Burke, 2012 FCA 139. \n11 See Canada (Attorney General) v Somwaru, 2010 FCA 336; and Canada (Attorney General) v Kaler, \n2011 FCA 266. \n12 See Canada (Attorney General) v Somwaru, 2010 FCA 336; and Canada (Attorney General) v Kaler, \n2011 FCA 266. \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n The Appellant has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means that he \nhas to show that it is more likely than not that he had good cause for the delay. \n\n The Appellant says that he had good cause for the delay because he wasn’t \n\nfamiliar with claiming EI benefits. He thought that benefits were only available for people \nwho had been laid-off from their jobs. He says that he wasn’t laid-off from his job, he \nwas dismissed. \n\n He says that the only time he had claimed EI benefits before was during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. His employer told him then that benefits were available and he \nshould for them. …. \n\n The Commission says that the Appellant hasn’t shown good cause for the delay \n\nbecause he hadn’t acted as a reasonable person in his situation. He didn’t try to verify \n\nhis rights and obligations under the Act for almost a year. \n\n They say that he had filed for benefits in the past and was aware of the Service \nCanada website. He had used the website in 2019 when he had filed for benefits. He \nshould have been aware that there were time frames to file for benefits. \n\n I find that the Appellant hasn’t proven that he had good cause for the delay in \napplying for benefits. \n\n He says that he thought EI benefits were only available for people who had been \nlaid-off. His evidence was that he thought it was insurance for people who were laid -off. \nHe didn’t think he could apply for benefits because he had been dismissed for \nperformance issues. \n\n He says that he wasn’t told by his employer that he could apply for benefits. A \nfriend mentioned that he might be eligible for benefits even if he was dismissed. He \napplied immediately after that.13 \n\n \n13 See GD3-29 \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\n The Appellant says that there was no other reason that prevented him from \napplying for benefits. He wasn’t sick, in jail or in training in the previous 2 years. 14 \n\n The cases say that ignorance of the law doesn’t constitute good cause unless the \nAppellant can show what they did was reasonable in the circumstances.15 \n\n Here, the Appellant’s conduct wasn’t reasonable in the circumstances. When he \n\nlost his job, he didn’t take any steps to find out if he was eligible for benefits for almost a \n\nyear.  \n\n He was aware of EI benefits and had claimed them previously. There was \nnothing preventing him from finding out if he was eligible for benefits. He only took steps \nto verify his rights and obligations under the Act after speaking to a friend. \n\n The cases say that the Appellant has to take reasonably prompt steps to \nunderstand their entitlement to benefits and their obligations under the Act.16 The \nAppellant didn’t take reasonably prompt steps to find out about benefits. \n\n There is no question about the good faith of the Appellant. However, the case \nlaw also says that ignorance of the law and good faith don’t constitute good cause for \n\ndelay in applying for benefits.17 \n\n I don’t need to consider whether the Appellant qualified for benefits on the earlier \nday. If the Appellant doesn’t have good cause, his application can’t be treated as though \n\nit was made earlier. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n14 See GD3-29 and GD3-30 \n15 See Quadir v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 21 \n16 See Canada (Attorney General) v Kaler, 2011 FCA 266 \n17 See Canada (Attorney General) v Carry, 2005 FCA 367 \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nConclusion \n The Appellant doesn’t have enough hours to qualify for benefits. \n\n The Appellant hasn’t proven that he had good cause for the delay in applying for \nbenefits throughout the entire period of the delay. \n\n This means that the appeals are dismissed. \n\nEdward Houlihan \nMember, General Division – Employment Insurance Section \n\n2024 SST 1648 (CanLII)"

B. \n  \nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission \n  \n\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission \nreconsideration decision (666598) dated June 12, 2024 \n(issued by Service Canada) \n\n  \n  \nTribunal member: Elyse Rosen \n  \nType of hearing: Videoconference \nHearing date: July 19, 2024 \nHearing participant: Appellant \nDecision date: July 19, 2024 \nFile number: GE-24-2316 \n\n \n\n2024 SST 1684 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nDecision \n[1] The appeal is allowed. \n\n[2] The Appellant is entitled to an extension of her benefit period that would allow \nher to be paid 15 weeks of maternity benefits, 35 weeks of standard parental benefits, \nand up to 26 weeks of sickness benefits. \n\nOverview \n[3] The Appellant applied for EI maternity and parental benefits. A benefit period was \nestablished effective March 5, 2023. \n\n[4] The Appellant received 15 weeks of maternity benefits from March 12, 2023, to \nJune 24, 2024, followed by 35 weeks of parental benefits from June 25, 2023, to \nFebruary 24, 2024. \n\n[5] During her parental leave the Appellant experienced two traumatic events. She \nwas diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  \n\n[6] When the leave period that the Appellant had arranged with her employer ended, \nshe wasn’t able to return to work as a result of her PTSD. Her doctor says she likely \nwon’t be able to return to work until September or October 2024.1  \n\n[7] The Appellant made a claim for sickness benefits on March 4, 2024. This is the \ndate when she had been expected to be back at work but couldn’t return. \n\n[8] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) says it can’t pay \n\nthe Appellant sickness benefits. It contends that her original benefit period can’t be \n\nextended and that she doesn’t have enough insurable hours to establish a new benefit \n\nperiod.2 \n\n \n1 See GD2-10. \n2 She would need 600 hours to establish a new benefit period. \n\n2024 SST 1684 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\n[9] The Appellant says she needs sickness benefits to pay for her living expenses \nand the costs of her treatment. \n\n[10] I have to decide if the Appellant is entitled to an extension of her benefit period. \n\nIssue \n[11] Can the Appellant’s benefit period be extended? \n\nAnalysis \n[12] I find that the Appellant’s benefit period can be extended to allow her to be paid \n\nup to the maximum total number of weeks of maternity, parental, and sickness benefits. \n\nThe law \n[13] When you make a claim for benefits, a benefit period is established. Your benefit \nperiod is the window of time during which benefits can be paid to you. \n\n[14] The length of a benefit period is normally 52 weeks, but it can be extended under \ncertain circumstances.3  \n\n[15] The fact that a benefit period is usually 52 weeks long doesn’t mean that \n\nclaimants are entitled to 52 weeks of benefits. Each type of benefits is paid for up to a \nmaximum number of weeks. Maternity benefits are paid for a maximum of 15 weeks, \nstandard parental benefits are paid for a maximum of 35 weeks, and sickness benefits \nare paid for a maximum of 26 weeks.4 \n\n[16] One of the circumstances where a benefit period can be extended is when a \nclaimant has received more than one type of special benefit in their benefit period but \nwould receive less than their maximum entitlement to at least one of those types of \nbenefits if the period for paying them ended after 52 weeks.5  \n\n \n3 See section 10(2) of the Employment Insurance Act (Act). \n4 See section 12(3) of the Act. \n5 See section 10(13) of the Act. \n\n2024 SST 1684 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n[17] Maternity, parental, and sickness benefits are all special benefits. \n\nThe Appellant’s circumstances \n[18] The Appellant established a benefit period on March 5, 2023. This means her \nbenefit period would normally have ended 52 weeks later on March 2, 2024.  \n\n[19] On February 24, 2024, she had received the maximum number of weeks of \nmaternity and parental benefits she was entitled to (15 weeks of maternity benefits and \n35 weeks of standard parental benefits, for a total of 50 weeks). This is the maximum \nallowable number of weeks of special benefits a claimant is entitled to unless their \nbenefit period is extended.6 \n\n[20] On March 4, 2024, the Appellant made a claim for sickness benefits because she \nwasn’t able to return to work following her parental leave as a result of her PTSD. But \n\nher illness had begun well before then. \n\nApplying the law to the Appellant’s circumstances \n[21] The Commission denied the Appellant’s claim for sickness benefits. It accepts \n\nthat the Appellant has proven she was too sick to work as of February 29, 2024. But it \ncontends that her benefit period terminated on February 24, 2024, once she received 50 \nweeks of maternity and parental benefits combined.  \n\n[22] The Commission advances that the Appellant would have been able to establish \na claim for sickness benefits as of February 25, 2024, but for the fact that her benefit \nperiod had already terminated by that date.7 It also argues that because she hasn’t \n\nproven that her incapacity began during her benefit period, she doesn’t qualify for an \n\nextension. \n\n[23] I don’t agree that the Appellant hasn’t proven that her incapacity began during \n\nher benefit period. From her testimony and from the medical evidence that she provided \n\n \n6 See section 12(5) of the Act. \n7 Claims start on the Sunday of the week you become entitled to benefits. Since the Appellant became \ntoo sick to work on February 29, 2024, her claim would have started on February 25, 2024, which is the \nSunday of that week. \n\n2024 SST 1684 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nwith her appeal, I find that the Appellant wasn’t capable of working as of at least as \n\nearly as September 2023.8  \n\n[24] The Commission argues that the medical information that the Appellant provided \nwith her appeal is ambiguous. I disagree. It clearly states that one of the events that led \nto her PTSD occurred in September 2023. And when read in light of the Appellant’s \n\ntestimony that some of the traumatic events mentioned in the medical evidence predate \nSeptember 2023, it’s clear to me that the medical evidence confirms she was too ill to \n\nwork at least as early as September 2023. \n\n[25] I also don’t agree with the Commission’s pretension that the Appellant’s benefit \n\nperiod terminated on February 24, 2024, after she received 50 weeks of benefits. The \nCommission is confounding the duration of the Appellant’s benefit period with the \n\nnumber of weeks of benefits she could be entitled to.  \n\n[26] In this case, the Appellant renewed her benefit period by making a claim for \nsickness benefits. So, her benefit period didn’t terminate on February 24, 2024. \n\n[27] The law says that you have three weeks from the week you are claiming benefits \nto make your claim.9 \n\n[28] On March 4, 2024, the Appellant filed a claim for sickness benefits. This means \nher claim could be antedated to as early as February 11, 2024. \n\n[29] Had the Commission converted the Appellant’s claim to a claim for sickness \n\nbenefits as of that date, the Appellant would have been entitled to an extension of her \nbenefit period to allow her to collect the maximum number of allowable weeks of both \nparental benefits and sickness benefits.10 This is because she would have been paid \n\n \n8 See GD2-9 and following. The medical certificate indicates that the Appellant witnessed a traumatic \nevent in September 2023 that led to her PTSD. \n9 See section 26 of the Employment Insurance Regulations (Regulations). \n10 See sections 10(13) and 12(6) of the Act. \n\n2024 SST 1684 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nboth parental benefits and sickness benefits for less than the maximum number of \nweeks allowable for each of those reasons.11 \n\n[30] Therefore, the Appellant is entitled to an extension of her benefit period so that \nshe can be paid 15 weeks of maternity benefits, 35 weeks of parental benefits, and up \nto 26 weeks of sickness benefits.12 \n\nConclusion \n[31] The appeal is allowed. \n\n[32] The Appellant is entitled to an extension of her benefit period that would allow \nher to be paid 15 weeks of maternity benefits, 35 weeks of standard parental benefits, \nand up to 26 weeks of sickness benefits. \n\nElyse Rosen \nMember, General Division – Employment Insurance Section \n\n \n11 Section 23(3.2) of the Act allow for the extension of the parental benefit window in these \ncircumstances. \n12 I say up to 26 weeks because at the time of writing this decision 26 weeks have not yet gone by from \nthe time the claim for sickness benefits should have been established. If the Appellant becomes well \nenough to work before the 26-week maximum entitlement ends, she would be entitled to be paid fewer \nthan 26 weeks of benefits. \n\n2024 SST 1684 (CanLII)"

    "body": "﻿Date: 20250604 \n\nDocket: IMM-11221-25 \n\nToronto, Ontario, June 4, 2025 \n\nPRESENT: Madam Justice McDonald \n\nBETWEEN: \n\nBHUPINDER SHARMA \n\nApplicant \n\nand \n\nTHE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND \nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS \n\nRespondent \n\nORDER \n\n[1] On this Motion, the Applicant, a citizen of India, requests an Order to stay his removal to \n\nIndia on Saturday, June 7, 2025. The underlying judicial review application is in relation to the \n\ndecision of the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] Officer decision of May 30, 2025, \n\nrefusing to defer his removal from Canada. At the hearing of this stay, legal counsel for the \n\nApplicant confirmed that he seeks a stay of removal until he is eligible for a Pre-Removal Risk \n\nAssessment (PRRA).   \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\n[2] For the reasons outlined below, I have concluded that the Applicant has not met the test \n\nto obtain a stay of removal and this Motion is dismissed. \n\nI. Background \n\n[3] The Applicant arrived in Canada in 2017 on a visitor visa and in 2019 made a claim for \n\nrefugee protection citing fear of persecution from his sister’s ex-husband. In September 2022, the \n\nRefugee Protection Division (RPD) denied his refugee claim citing credibility concerns and the \n\navailability of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) within India.  His appeal to the Refugee \n\nAppeal Division (RAD) was denied. \n\n[4] The Applicant sought judicial review of the RAD decision and in a Court decision dated \n\nAugust 21, 2024, the Federal Court dismissed his application (Sharma c Canada (Citoyenneté et \n\nImmigration), 2024 CF 1298). \n\n[5] On May 5, 2025, the Applicant was informed by CBSA that his removal was scheduled \n\nfor June 7, 2025.  On May 20, 2025, he submitted a request to CBSA for a deferral of his \n\nremoval citing new risk, humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] concerns, and concerns about \n\nthe quality of his former legal counsel representation.  \n\n[6] On May 30, 2025, CBSA denied his deferral request.  \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\nII. Stay of Removal  \n\n[7] On this Motion, the Applicant must satisfy the following three-part test: (1) there is a \n\nserious issue to be tried in the underlying judicial review application; (2) there will be irreparable \n\nharm if the stay of removal is not granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours \n\ngranting the stay of removal (Toth v Canada (MEI) (1988) 86 NR 302 (FCA) [Toth]).  \n\n[8] This test is conjunctive, meaning that an applicant must satisfy all three elements of the \n\ntest in order to be entitled to relief (Janssen Inc v Abbvie Corporation, 2014 FCA 112 at \n\npara 14). \n\nIII. Serious Issue \n\n[9] In determining whether a serious issue exists the Court must consider that the discretion \n\nof a CBSA Officer to defer removal is limited therefore the applicant must put forward quite a \n\nstrong case (Baron v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2009 \n\nFCA 81 at para 67). \n\n[10] On this Motion, the Applicant argues that there are several serious issues with the \n\nDeferral Decision including:  \n\n(i) The Officer failed to properly consider that the Applicant’s risks had never been \nproperly assessed because of the potential incompetence of his representative \nbefore the RPD, RAD and Federal Court; \n\n(ii) The Deferral Officer fettered their discretion by relying on the previous decisions \nof the RPD, RAD and the Federal Court; \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\n(iii) The Deferral Officer erred in assessing the short-term interests of his nephew by \nassessing it through a lens of hardship; and \n\n(iv) The Deferral Officer failed to consider the economic hardship that the Applicant \nwill suffer. \n\n[11] In my view, these are not serious issues (Toth) and do not constitute a strong case \n\n(Baron) for the reasons below. \n\n[12] The core of the Applicant’s submissions on this Motion is that his “risks” have never \n\nbeen properly assessed because he had incompetent representation at the RPD, RAD and before \n\nthe Federal Court. The Applicant submits that all three lawyers/consultants that represented him \n\nbefore the RPD, the RAD and the Federal Court were incompetent and they did not adequately \n\nrepresent his interests. The Deferral Officer considered this argument but found that there was \n\ninsufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Applicant should be granted a deferral to allow him \n\nto notify his former representatives of these allegations. \n\n[13] Despite the allegations of incompetent representation, the Applicant did not identify any \n\nevidence or documents that were not tendered on his behalf at any of the previous hearings. His \n\n“accusations” of incompetence appear to be more in the nature of disagreements with how his \n\nclaim was presented.  In any event, at this stage such allegations are purely speculative and do \n\nnot constitute clear and convincing evidence sufficient to support a stay of removal.   \n\n[14] On the risks regarding the Applicant’s sister’s ex-husband, the Officer noted that the \n\nApplicant had his risk assessed by the RPD and the RAD, and that the Federal Court upon \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\njudicial review found the RAD decision to be reasonable.  It is not a fettering of discretion for \n\nthe Officer to rely upon these findings in the absence of new evidence.  Further, the Officer \n\nfound that the recent evidence of risk from his sister’s ex-husband (the same agent of harm) did \n\nnot impact the RPD and RAD findings regarding the IFA.   \n\n[15] In considering the best interests of the Applicant’s nephew, the Deferral Officer is only \n\nrequired to consider the short-term best interests of the child such as finishing a school year, \n\nongoing medical care, and ensuring there will be someone to care for the child (Lewis v Canada \n\n(Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FCA 130 [Lewis] at paras 82-83).  Here the \n\nOfficer was alive and alert to the short-term and immediate best interests of the child. The \n\nOfficer notes that the Applicant’s nephew will continue to be supported by his mother and other \n\nfamily members in Canada.  \n\n[16] On the Applicant’s alleged hardship in returning to India, the Officer notes that the \n\nApplicant will be returning to his country of birth and citizenship where he is familiar with the \n\nland, language, cultures, religions and governments. He will have the opportunity to re-unite \n\nwith his spouse, children and other family members upon his return.  Without direct evidence \n\nthat the Applicant will suffer economic hardship beyond the normal consequences of removal, I \n\nam satisfied the Officer reasonably addressed the concerns raised by the Applicant.   \n\n[17] In summary, the Applicant has not established a serious issue with the Deferral decision.    \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\nIV. Irreparable harm \n\n[18] The test for irreparable harm is strict, and it implies a serious likelihood of jeopardy to \n\nthe applicant’s life, security or safety and it requires evidence going beyond the inherent \n\nconsequences of deportation (Palka v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \n\nPreparedness) 2008 FCA 165 para 12). \n\n[19] The Applicant claims to be at risk of harm from his sister’s ex-husband, claiming \n\nevidence has not been properly assessed due to inadequate legal representation. The Applicant’s \n\nirreparable harm risks are based on his claim that he had incompetent representation before the \n\nRPD, RAD and the Federal Court and therefore his risks have not been properly assessed.  As \n\nnoted above, I do not consider this argument to amount to a serious issue nor to irreparable harm. \n\nThe risk relating to his sister’s ex-husband have been addressed at each stage of these \n\nproceedings, and it has been found that the Applicant has an IFA within India.  \n\n[20] The Applicant relies on Jamal v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n\n2021 CanLII 117818 (FC) (which relies upon Kambasaya v Canada (Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 2021 FC 664) to argue that he would be deprived of a meaningful remedy in \n\nrelation to his underlying judicial review application if he is removed from Canada.  However, \n\nJamal is factually distinct from the circumstances of this case.  Most notably in Jamal, \n\nirreparable harm was considered in relation to an outstanding H&C application.  There is no \n\nH&C application at issue in this case.  The underlying judicial review application relates to the \n\nCBSA refusal to defer a stay of removal and as noted above, the Applicant has not identified a \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nserious issue with that Decision.  In any event, irreparable harm is not established simply by the \n\nexistence of a pending application (Baron at paras 87–88).  \n\n[21] The Applicant further submits that removal would separate him from his nephew.  For \n\nseparation from family members to amount to irreparable harm, the potential hardship caused by \n\nremoval must be beyond the usual consequences of removal.  Although the Applicant will be \n\nseparated, there is no clear, convincing, and non-speculative evidence to demonstrate that harm \n\nwill occur beyond the inherent consequences of removal. \n\n[22] On these facts, the Applicant has not established irreparable harm. \n\n[23] Having not established a serious issue or irreparable harm, the balance of convenience \n\nlies with the Minister and the duty to enforce removal orders as soon as possible as per \n\nsubsection 48(2) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27.  \n\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that this Motion for a stay of removal is dismissed. \n\n \n\n\"Ann Marie McDonald\" \n Judge \n\n \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51584 (FC)"

She seeks the stay \n\nuntil the determination of her Applications for Leave and for Judicial Review of a negative Pre-\n\nRemoval Risk Assessment (PRRA), and a refused application for permanent residence on \n\nhumanitarian and compassionate grounds (H&C), both dated March 18, 2025. \n\n[2] For the reasons outlined below, I have concluded that the Applicant has not met the test \n\nfor a stay of removal and the Motions are dismissed. \n\nI. Background \n\n[3] In 2021, the Applicant entered Canada on a study permit. She later claimed refugee \n\nprotection, citing gender-based violence (GBV), including forced marriage and past experiences \n\nof female genital mutilation (FGM). \n\n[4] On January 11, 2023, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denied her refugee claim on \n\nthe grounds that she did not credibly establish her identity or her core allegations.  She was \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51585 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\nscheduled for removal from Canada on May 25, 2023, and had a Motion to stay her removal \n\nheard by Justice Strickland.  By Court Order dated May 24, 2023, Justice Strickland denied the \n\nApplicant’s request for a stay of removal.  The Applicant failed to appear for removal and a \n\nwarrant was issued for her arrest. \n\n[5] The Applicant turned herself into Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] and was \n\ngiven a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA).  She also filed a H&C application.  On March \n\n18, 2025 both the PRRA and the H&C application were refused by the same Officer. \n\n[6] On May 12, 2025, she was issued a Direction to Report (DTR) for removal on June 6, \n\n2025. \n\nII. Stay of removal \n\n[7] To obtain a stay of removal, the Applicant must satisfy the following three-part test: (1) \n\nthere is a serious issue to be tried in the underlying judicial review application; (2) there will be \n\nirreparable harm if the stay is not granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours \n\ngranting the stay (Toth v Canada (MEI) (1988) 86 NR 302 (FCA) [Toth]).  \n\n[8] This test is conjunctive, meaning that an applicant must satisfy all three elements of the \n\ntest to be entitled to relief (Janssen Inc v Abbvie Corporation, 2014 FCA 112 at para 14). \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51585 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nIII. Serious issue \n\n[9] The Applicant argues that a serious issue arises as the PRRA failed to assess GBV risks \n\nspecific to her profile as a single woman and FGM survivor.  She also claims that the H&C \n\ndecision failed to address her Affidavit evidence and the medical evidence. \n\n[10] On the GBV risks in the PRRA application, the Officer notes that her risks as a young \n\nfemale in Kenya were the same risks as assessed in her RPD hearing.  The risk alleged before the \n\nRPD was the Applicant’s fear that her father arranged her marriage with an older man. The risk \n\narguments made on the PRRA application were nuanced and focused more generally on the \n\nGBV in Kenya rather than just the alleged forced marriage.  Nonetheless in her Affidavit filed in \n\nsupport of her PRRA, she refers to the risk of a forced marriage.  As this risk was previously \n\nassessed by the RPD, it did not qualify as a “new” risk to be assessed by the PRRA Officer.   \n\n[11] The Applicant points to an incomplete sentence in the PRRA decision regarding the \n\nOfficer’s analysis of new evidence as an indication that her Affidavit evidence was not fully \n\nconsidered.  I do not agree that an incomplete sentence or a typo in the PRRA decision supports \n\nthe Applicant’s assertion that her evidence was not considered.   \n\n[12] The Applicant also argues that the PRRA Officer erred by not conducting a section 97 \n\nanalysis. Here the PRRA Officer accepted that there is gender-based discrimination in Kenya, \n\nbut also reasonably determined that the Applicant had not adduced sufficient evidence to \n\nestablish that her safety and life would be in danger in Kenya.   \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51585 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\n[13] On the H&C application, the Applicant argues that the Officer fettered his discretion by \n\nnot considering and weighing the evidence. The Applicant argues that she would experience \n\nhardship due to the lack of access and availability of health care and mental health services in \n\nKenya and would also experience hardship due to the prevalence of GBV. I am satisfied that the \n\nOfficer assessed these factors and weighed the evidence accordingly. Although the H&C Officer \n\ndoes not necessarily mention every piece of evidence, there is nothing to suggest that the Officer \n\nfailed to weigh and consider all the evidence even if it is not specially referenced (Kanagendren \n\nv Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FCA 86 at para 36).  \n\n[14] While the Applicant raises several issues with the PRRA and H&C decisions, and even \n\nthough the threshold to establish serious issue is low, I am not satisfied those issues rise to the \n\nlevel of a serious issue such as to satisfy the first branch of the Toth test.  In any event, even if \n\nshe can establish a serious issue, she has not established irreparable harm. \n\nIV. Irreparable harm \n\n[15] The test for irreparable harm is strict, and it implies a serious likelihood of jeopardy to \n\nthe applicant’s life, security or safety and it requires evidence going beyond the inherent \n\nconsequences of deportation (Palka v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \n\nPreparedness) 2008 FCA 165 para 12). \n\n[16] On these stay Motions, the serious issues arguments and the irreparable harm arguments \n\noverlap.  On irreparable harm, the Applicant alleges GBV, a forced marriage and psychological \n\ntrauma. The risk of a forced marriage was assessed in the PRRA and was also considered and \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51585 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\ndismissed by the RPD.  Risks that have been previously assessed by the RPD and raised again in \n\nthe context of a PRRA are not sufficient to establish “irreparable harm” on a Motion for a stay.  \n\nHere the Applicant has had the benefit of having these risks assessed, unlike in the case of Thuo \n\nv Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 48 [Thuo], where this Court \n\nhas held that where an enforcement officer finds that a risk has not been assessed, the proper \n\nremedy is to defer removal and to proceed to a PRRA, and where an enforcement officer fails to \n\ndefer removal despite the fact that a significant risk was not assessed, an applicant need only \n\nshow a prima facie case of irreparable harm (Thuo at paras 19 and 21). That is not the case here. \n\n[17] The Applicant argues that her medical evidence is new evidence that was not previously \n\nassessed.  The new evidence on her physical health (knee condition, vision loss) does not \n\nindicate that she requires emergency or time-sensitive treatment for these conditions.  Further, \n\nthere is no evidence that such treatments are not available in Kenya.  \n\n[18] There is evidence from a clinical social worker and a nurse practitioner on her mental \n\nhealth issues stating that she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicidal \n\nideation.  The reports note that her conditions would worsen upon removal. Unfortunately stress, \n\nanxiety, and depression caused by the prospect of removal is an inherent consequence of removal \n\n(Palka at para 17).  Further, as noted by Justice Aylen in Enodumwenben v Canada (Public \n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness), [2024] FCJ No 2115 CanLII:  “medical reports prepared \n\nin anticipation of removal (such as this) should be approached with some caution and irreparable \n\nharm is not established by anxiety, even where accompanied by suicidal ideation, when these \n\nsymptoms are clearly linked to a pending removal, as is the case here.” \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51585 (FC)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\n[19] Therefore, the Applicant has not established irreparable harm. \n\nV. Balance of convenience \n\n[20] In the absence of a serious issue and irreparable harm, the balance of convenience \n\nfavours the Minister and the duty to enforce removal orders as soon as possible as per \n\nsubsection 48(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27.  \n\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that this Motion for a stay of removal is dismissed. \n\n \n\n\"Ann Marie McDonald\" \n Judge \n\n \n\n \n\n2025 CanLII 51585 (FC)"

Aperçu \n\n[1] Le demandeur, M. Chafik Moustaid, était titulaire d’un permis de Consultant réglementé \n\nen immigration canadienne [CRIC] du Collège des consultants en immigration et en citoyenneté \n\n[CCIC ou Collège] depuis le 19 mai 2021. Le 8 juillet 2022, en vertu des pouvoirs réglementaires \n\nqui lui sont conférés par la Loi sur le Collège des consultants en immigration et en citoyenneté, \n\nLC 2019, c 29, le registraire du CCIC, par le biais d’un avis de révocation, a révoqué le permis de \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 2 \n\nM. Moustaid à la suite du non-paiement d’une partie des cotisations requises dans les délais \n\nimpartis [Décision en révocation]. \n\n[2] Bien que M. Moustaid ait par la suite payé, hors délai, les versements de cotisation dus, le \n\n7 juillet 2023, le CCIC a rendu une décision par laquelle il refusait la demande de M. Moustaid en \n\nréadhésion d’un titulaire de permis révoqué [Décision en réadhésion]. M. Moustaid a reçu la \n\nDécision en réadhésion le 31 juillet 2023. \n\n[3] M. Moustaid a fait appel de ces deux décisions devant le Comité d’appel du CCIC [Comité \n\nd’appel] qui, dans une décision rendue le 7 février 2024, a rejeté l’appel. De plus, après avoir \n\nfourni aux parties une opportunité de s’entendre sur les dépens en lien avec l’appel ou à défaut, de \n\nfaire des représentations quant à ceux-ci, le 4 mars 2024, le Comité d’appel a accordé des dépens \n\nau CCIC. Ces décisions du 7 février 2024 et du 4 mars 2024 font l’objet du présent contrôle \n\njudiciaire [collectivement désignées la « Décision contestée »]. \n\n[4] M. Moustaid fait valoir que dans la Décision contestée, le Comité d’appel a commis \n\nplusieurs erreurs justifiant à cette Cour de décerner un bref de certiorari en vertu de l’alinéa 18(1)a) \n\nde la Loi sur les Cours fédérales, LRC 1985, c F-7. Plus spécifiquement, il soulève que le Comité \n\nd’appel n’a pas observé des principes d’équité procédurale en rendant la Décision contestée et \n\nqu’il a commis des erreurs en fait et en droit. M. Moustaid demande donc à la Cour d’infirmer la \n\nDécision contestée et de retourner le dossier pour réanalyse, conformément aux instructions que \n\nla Cour estimera appropriées. Il demande également de condamner le CCIC aux frais de justice et \n\nde rendre toute autre ordonnance que la Cour jugera appropriée. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 3 \n\n[5] Au soutien de sa demande, M. Moustaid dépose son propre affidavit assermenté le 26 juin \n\n2024, auquel il joint 16 pièces, soit 3 onglets et 13 pièces avec annexes jointes. M. Moustaid n’a \n\npas été contre-interrogé. \n\n[6] Notons que bien que M. Moustaid fût initialement représenté par un avocat, il s’est \n\nreprésenté seul lors de l’audition devant cette Cour. Malgré ce fait, ses représentations étaient \n\nclaires et présentées avec professionnalisme. \n\n[7] Le CCIC s’oppose à la demande de contrôle judiciaire de M. Moustaid et répond que la \n\nDécision contestée est raisonnable et commande la retenue. Le CCIC soumet notamment que les \n\narguments de M. Moustaid reviennent à une demande de réévaluer les conclusions factuelles et \n\ndiscrétionnaires du Comité d’appel, ce qui n’est pas permis en l’absence de circonstances \n\nexceptionnelles. Enfin, le CCIC s’oppose également au fait que M. Moustaid tente d’introduire \n\ncertains arguments qui n’étaient pas devant le Comité d’appel. \n\n[8] Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire de M. Moustaid est accueillie. \n\nÀ la suite de l’examen de la preuve au dossier, des arguments présentés par M. Moustaid et des \n\nmotifs du Comité d’appel, la Cour est d’avis que la Décision contestée est déraisonnable. \n\nII. Question préliminaire \n\n[9] Bien que M. Moustaid demande le contrôle judiciaire de deux décisions distinctes, c’est-\n\nà-dire la Décision en réadhésion du 7 février 2024 ainsi que la décision sur les dépens du 4 mars \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 4 \n\n2024, la Cour est d’avis qu’elle peut exercer sa discrétion conformément à la Règle 302 des Règles \n\ndes Cours fédérales, DORS/98-106 pour rendre une seule ordonnance puisqu’elles constituent un \n\nseul acte continu, soit le rejet de l’appel et les dépens qui en découlent. Cette conclusion est fondée \n\nsur les critères résumés par la juge Kane dans Fondation David Suzuki c Canada (Santé), 2018 CF \n\n380 au paragraphe 173. D’ailleurs, aucune des parties n’a soulevé d’enjeu en lien avec la Règle \n\n302 et la Cour est d’avis que de procéder à des contrôles judiciaires distincts alors que les décisions \n\nsont étroitement liées, entraînerait une perte de temps et d’énergie inutile dans les circonstances. \n\nIII. Sommaire des faits \n\nA. Événements menant à la révocation du permis de M. Moustaid \n\n[10] Depuis le 19 mai 2021, M. Moustaid était titulaire d’un permis de CRIC et devait acquitter \n\nune cotisation annuelle qu’il avait choisi de payer en versements trimestriels, par le biais de \n\nprélèvements automatiques dans son compte de banque. Selon le Règlement sur la cotisation \n\nannuelle, les frais, les amendes et les pénalités, version 2021-001, à son article 4.1, la cotisation \n\n2021-2022 était payable en quatre versements égaux de 520,05 $, les 1er juillet 2021, 1er octobre \n\n2021, 1er janvier 2022 et 1er avril 2022. \n\n[11] Le 7 mars 2022, à la suite du non-paiement du versement du 1er janvier 2022, le CCIC \n\nachemine à M. Moustaid un avis de suspension pour avoir fait défaut de payer le troisième \n\nversement au jour prescrit. Selon cet avis de suspension, le 3 février 2022, un avis final de paiement \n\nlui avait préalablement été transmis. Le 18 mars 2022, la suspension de son permis est levée suivant \n\nle paiement de ce troisième versement. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 5 \n\n[12] Toutefois, M. Moustaid fait à nouveau défaut de payer son quatrième versement de \n\ncotisation le 1er avril 2022. Un nouvel avis final de paiement lui est alors acheminé le 2 mai 2022. \n\nNotons que cet avis final de paiement indique clairement que si M. Moustaid ne paie pas les frais \n\nen souffrance avant le 1er juin 2022, son permis de CRIC serait suspendu sans aucun autre avis. \n\n[13] N’ayant pas fait ce paiement dans les délais, le 6 juin 2022, M. Moustaid reçoit un avis de \n\nsuspension. Notons que cet avis de suspension indique clairement que s’il ne payait pas les frais \n\nen souffrance avant le 6 juillet 2022, son permis de CRIC serait automatiquement révoqué. \n\n[14] N’ayant pas remédié à la situation, le 8 juillet 2022, M. Moustaid reçoit la Décision en \n\nrévocation qui indique que son permis de CRIC est révoqué avec effet immédiat, conformément \n\nau paragraphe 20.6 du Règlement administratif 2021-2 du CCIC [Règlement]. \n\n[15] Cela dit, conformément à l’article 20.7 du Règlement, M. Moustaid pouvait porter la \n\nDécision en révocation en appel auprès d’un Comité d’appel dans les 30 jours. Il ne l’a pas fait \n\ndans lesdits 30 jours suivant la réception de la Décision en révocation. \n\n[16] La Cour souligne que selon la preuve au dossier, l’ensemble des avis mentionnés ici-haut \n\nont été transmis à M.°Moustaid à la même adresse électronique qu’il a subséquemment utilisée \n\npour communiquer avec le registraire du CCIC et son avocat. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 6 \n\nB. Événements suivant la révocation du permis de CRIC de M. Moustaid \n\n[17] Le 24 juillet 2022, alors que son permis de CRIC était déjà révoqué, M. Moustaid procède \n\nau quatrième et dernier versement de sa cotisation annuelle 2021-2022 ainsi que le premier \n\nversement de sa cotisation annuelle 2022-2023. La Cour souligne que bien que cette preuve ne soit \n\npas au dossier, M. Moustaid a confirmé à l’audience que ces versements ont été conservés par le \n\nCCIC. \n\n[18] Entre octobre 2022 et juin 2023, plusieurs échanges ont eu lieu entre M. Moustaid et le \n\nbureau du registraire du CCIC concernant la révocation de son permis. Plus particulièrement, le \n\n1er novembre 2022, par le biais d’un courriel, M. Moustaid a notamment été informé par le CCIC \n\nque conformément à l’article 6.3 du Règlement sur la démission d’un CRIC, les anciens titulaires \n\nde permis révoqués pouvaient être réadmis à titre de CIRC, mais qu’une telle demande était \n\nassujettie aux mêmes exigences en matière de délivrance de permis que celles qui s’appliquent aux \n\nnouveaux demandeurs de permis, y compris la réussite du Programme d’études supérieures à \n\nl’Université de Montréal ou à l’Université Queen’s. \n\n[19] De plus, toujours dans l’échange du 1er novembre 2022, M. Moustaid a été informé par le \n\nregistraire du CCIC que les renseignements concernant les appels des décisions du CCIC se \n\ntrouvent dans le Règlement. Bien que M. Moustaid était déjà hors délai, il n’a pris aucune mesure \n\npour tenter de déposer un avis d’appel à ce moment, autre que d’envoyer une mise en demeure le \n\n16 janvier 2023 sommant le CICC de lui restituer son permis d’exercice dans un délai de 15 jours. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 7 \n\n[20] En fait, ce n’est que le 6 avril 2023 que M. Moustaid avise le CCIC de son intention d’en \n\nappeler de la décision de révocation rendue le 8 juillet 2022. Puis, le 14 avril 2023, M. Moustaid \n\ntransmet une lettre datée du 13 avril 2023 détaillant ses arguments visant principalement la non-\n\nvalidité des avis envoyés par le CCIC. Il reproche également au CCIC de ne pas avoir indiqué son \n\ndroit d’appel dans la Décision en révocation, ni les délais applicables. Il demande alors que la \n\nrévocation de son permis soit annulée et que son permis lui soit restitué ou qu’il soit réadmis à titre \n\nde CRIC en renonçant aux exigences prévues à l’article 6.3 du Règlement sur la démission d’un \n\nCRIC. \n\n[21] Outre les critiques de M. Moustaid sur le contenu ou la forme des avis, il fournit cette \n\nexplication en lien avec son non-paiement : \n\nDans le courant de l’été 2022, j’ai traversé une période familiale \ndifficile et j’en ai malencontreusement oublié de procéder dans les \ndélais prescrits au paiement de ma cotisation annuelle due au 6 juin \n2022. Aucun avis ne m’a été communiqué à cette occasion, de sorte \nque j’ignorais alors complètement que j’étais en défaut. \n\n[22] M. Moustaid ne fournit toutefois aucun renseignement sur ses qualifications scolaires ni \n\naucune information qui pourrait justifier une exemption quant aux exigences requises pour qu’un \n\nnouveau permis lui soit délivré. \n\n[23] Le 31 juillet 2023, M. Moustaid reçoit la Décision en réadhésion qui indique qu’il pourrait \n\nréadhérer à titre de CRIC après avoir satisfait à des conditions, dont (1) satisfaire à l’exigence des \n\nétudes préalables en obtenant un diplôme d’études supérieures spécialisées agréé par le CCIC, soit \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 8 \n\nde l’Université de Montréal ou de l’Université Queen’s; et (2) franchir toutes les étapes de la \n\ndélivrance d’un permis, y compris l’examen d’accès à la pratique [EAP]. \n\n[24] Le 22 août 2023, M. Moustaid porte la Décision en réadhésion en appel au moyen d’un \n\navis d’appel auquel il joint 15 annexes. Les arguments qu’il soulève dans son avis d’appel peuvent \n\nse résumer ainsi : \n\na. M. Moustaid soumet que la Décision en réadhésion comporte une erreur de fait, car il y est \n\nindiqué que son admission était à partir du 1 mars 2021 alors qu’elle est datée du 19 mai \n\n2021. Notons d’emblée que cet argument n’a aucune incidence sur les décisions rendues; \n\nb. Il soumet également qu’il est faux que la révocation a eu lieu après l’envoi de plusieurs \n\navis, alors qu’il n’a pas reçu l’avis de paiement final, ni l’avis de suspension préalable à la \n\nrévocation. Notons toutefois que M. Moustaid admet avoir reçu des courriels automatisés \n\ndu département de comptabilité le 13 juin 2022 et le 4 juillet 2022 l’informant que le \n\nprélèvement automatique du 1er avril 2022 n’avait pas fonctionné et que le versement était \n\ntoujours dû. M. Moustaid admet également avoir reçu la Décision en révocation le 8 juillet \n\n2022 mais soumet que celui-ci indiquait qu’il s’appuyait sur l’article 20.6 du Règlement, \n\nlequel prévoit le droit du CCIC de révoquer le permis dans le cas où la suspension du \n\npermis se poursuit au-delà de 90 jours. Ainsi, M. Moustaid soumet que même s’il avait \n\nreçu l’avis de suspension préalable à la révocation du 6 juin 2022 (ce qu’il nie), le délai de \n\n90 jours de la suspension ne s’était pas encore concrétisé au moment où il a reçu la Décision \n\nen révocation le 8 juillet 2022; \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 9 \n\nc. Le registraire aurait également erré en fait et en droit en ne traitant que de sa demande de \n\nréadhésion, sans traiter de sa demande préalable d’annulation de la Décision en révocation \n\nfaite par le biais de sa lettre du 13 avril 2023, le tout sans explication; \n\nd. M. Moustaid soumet également que la Décision en révocation n’indiquait pas clairement \n\nson droit d’appel et son délai pour le faire, ce qui constitue selon lui une erreur grave l’ayant \n\nempêché de porter la décision en appel; \n\ne. D’abondant, au niveau de la Décision de réadhésion, M. Moustaid soumet que le registraire \n\nse fonde erronément sur l’article 6.3 du Règlement sur la démission, version 2021-001 alors \n\nqu’il n’a jamais eu l’intention de démissionner. Le registraire aurait plutôt dû se baser sur \n\nl’article 13.2 du Règlement; et \n\nf. Le CCIC a rejeté sa demande d’exemption aux conditions de réadhésion, incluse dans la \n\nlettre transmise le 14 avril 2023, sans expliquer pourquoi. \n\n[25] Au soutien de son avis d’appel, M. Moustaid a déposé (1) une déclaration sous serment \n\ndatée du 3 octobre 2023 accompagnée des annexes 16 à 23; (2) une déclaration sous serment \n\nmodifiée datée du 16 octobre 2023 accompagnée des annexes 16 à 23, incluant une nouvelle \n\nannexe 17.1; (3)°une réponse au formulaire de preuve déposé par le CCIC et ses arguments écrits \n\nsous forme de déclaration sous serment datée du 10 novembre 2023; et (4) une réponse aux \n\narguments du CCIC en date du 11 décembre 2023. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 10 \n\n[26] En réponse, le CCIC a déposé (1) un formulaire de preuve du témoin Catherine Leslie \n\nPappas, directrice de l’enregistrement du CCIC, daté du 1er octobre 2023 et accompagné de 18 \n\npièces de preuve; (2) un formulaire supplémentaire de preuve par témoin de Mme Pappas, daté du \n\n13 octobre 2023 accompagné de 8 pièces de preuve dont quatre nouvelles pièces; et (3) des \n\narguments écrits datés du 1er décembre 2023. \n\nIV. Décisions en contrôle judiciaire \n\n[27] Le 9 février 2024, le Comité d’appel rejette l’appel de M. Moustaid et note, inter alia, les \n\nconclusions suivantes : \n\na. La norme de contrôle applicable est celle énoncée dans Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté \n\net de l’Immigration) c Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 [Vavilov], soit (1) la décision correcte sur des \n\nquestions de droit pur, et (2) l’erreur manifeste et dominante sur des questions de fait mixte \n\net de droit ou de fait pur; \n\nb. Le Comité d’appel est convaincu que M. Moustaid a pu recevoir et a envoyé de nombreuses \n\ncommunications via le système de courrier électronique qu’il a choisi; aucun témoignage \n\nd’expert, preuve documentaire ou explications raisonnables concrètes n’ont été présentés \n\nsuggérant que l’un des courriels clés, comme l’avis de suspension ou la Décision en \n\nrévocation, n’avaient pas été reçu par M.°Moustaid; \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 11 \n\nc. Basé sur la preuve au dossier, le Comité d’appel n’est pas convaincu que M.°Moustaid \n\nn’était pas au courant de sa suspension et de sa révocation ultérieure aux dates pertinentes \n\nou peu après; \n\nd. Bien que le Comité d’appel puisse comprendre les difficultés vécues par M.°Moustaid au \n\ncours de l’été 2022, ce dernier ne les a pas communiqués au CCIC en temps opportun de \n\nsorte qu’on ne peut pas s’attendre à ce que le CCIC invoque des dispositions du Règlement \n\nqui lui permet de prendre d’autres modalités de paiement; \n\ne. Bien que M. Moustaid ait raison que les courriels du CCIC ne contiennent aucun détail sur \n\nle droit d’appel ou sur les avis de suspension et de révocation, l’absence d’une référence \n\nau droit d’appel ne les rend pas déficients puisque ce droit est clairement prévu dans le \n\nRèglement. Malgré ce fait, le Comité d’appel recommande fortement que dans le futur toute \n\ndécision administrative du CCIC communiquée par écrit comprenne un paragraphe sur le \n\ndroit d’appel et sa procédure; et \n\nf. Quant à la question portant sur la demande de réinscription de M. Moustaid, le Comité \n\nd’appel est d’avis qu’il n’est pas clair que M. Moustaid ait effectivement fait une telle \n\ndemande. De plus, puisqu’il n’y aucune indication dans la Décision en révocation selon \n\nlaquelle les qualifications existantes de M. Moustaid ne le qualifieraient pas pour \n\nl’inscription, le Comité d’appel juge que le CCIC n’a pas rendu de décision à ce sujet et \n\nqu’il serait donc prématuré pour le Comité d’appel d’envisager une telle décision \n\nconcernant un appel. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 12 \n\n[28] Quant aux dépens, le Comité d’appel indique que le CCIC devrait avoir une certaine \n\nindemnisation pour ses dépens et invite les parties à s’entendre à ce sujet, à défaut de quoi des \n\nsoumissions écrites additionnelles devraient être déposées par les parties. Les parties ne s’étant pas \n\nentendues au sujet des dépens, des représentations additionnelles ont été déposées et \n\nsubséquemment, le 4 mars 2024, le Comité d’appel ordonne M. Moustaid à payer 7 910 $ au CCIC, \n\nsoit les deux tiers du montant des dépens réels de 11 865,00$. Conformément aux représentations \n\ndu CCIC, ce montant exclut les débours liés à la traduction. \n\nV. Analyse \n\nA. Norme de contrôle \n\n[29] Les parties soutiennent que la norme de la décision raisonnable s’applique. La Cour est \n\nd’accord que c’est bel et bien la norme de contrôle applicable dans le cadre de la présente demande. \n\n[30] Dans sa décision récente, Mailloux c Canada (Procureur général), 2025 CF 583, le juge \n\nGascon résume bien la norme de contrôle applicable: \n\n[17] Lorsque la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision \nraisonnable, le rôle d’une cour de révision est d’examiner les motifs \nqu’a donnés le décideur administratif et de déterminer si la décision \nest fondée sur « une analyse intrinsèquement cohérente et \nrationnelle » et est « justifiée au regard des contraintes juridiques et \nfactuelles auxquelles le décideur est assujetti » (Mason au para 64 ; \nVavilov au para 85). La cour de révision doit donc se demander « si \nla décision possède les caractéristiques d’une décision raisonnable, \nsoit la justification, la transparence et l’intelligibilité » (Vavilov au \npara 99, citant notamment Dunsmuir c Nouveau-Brunswick, 2008 \nCSC 9 aux para 47, 74). \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 13 \n\n[18] Il ne suffit pas que la décision soit justifiable. Dans les cas où \ndes motifs s’imposent, le décideur administratif « doit également, au \nmoyen de ceux-ci, justifier sa décision auprès des personnes \nauxquelles elle s’applique » [en italique dans l’original] (Vavilov au \npara 86). Ainsi, le contrôle en fonction de la norme de la décision \nraisonnable s’intéresse tant au résultat de la décision qu’au \nraisonnement suivi (Vavilov au para 87). L’exercice du contrôle \nselon la norme de la décision raisonnable doit comporter une \névaluation rigoureuse des décisions administratives. Toutefois, dans \nle cadre de son analyse du caractère raisonnable d’une décision, la \ncour de révision doit adopter une méthode qui « s’intéresse avant \ntout aux motifs de la décision », examiner les motifs donnés avec \n« une attention respectueuse », et chercher à comprendre le fil du \nraisonnement suivi par le décideur pour en arriver à sa conclusion \n(Mason aux para 58, 60 ; Vavilov au para 84). \n\n[19] La cour de révision doit adopter une attitude de retenue et \nn’intervenir que « lorsque cela est vraiment nécessaire pour \npréserver la légitimité, la rationalité et l’équité du processus \nadministratif » (Vavilov au para 13). La norme de la décision \nraisonnable, la Cour le souligne, tire toujours son origine du principe \nde la retenue judiciaire et de la déférence, et elle exige des cours de \nrévision qu’elles témoignent d’un respect envers le rôle distinct que \nle législateur a choisi de conférer aux décideurs administratifs plutôt \nqu’aux cours de justice (Mason au para 57; Vavilov aux para 13, 46, \n75). \n\n[20] Il incombe à la partie qui conteste une décision de prouver \nqu’elle est déraisonnable. Pour annuler une décision administrative, \nla cour de révision doit être convaincue qu’il existe des lacunes \nsuffisamment graves pour rendre la décision déraisonnable (Vavilov \nau para 100). \n\n[31] Toutefois, lorsqu’il est question d’équité procédurale, aucune norme de contrôle n’est \n\nappliquée, mais l’exercice de contrôle de la Cour est « particulièrement bien reflété dans la norme \n\nde la décision correcte » (Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limitée c Canada (Procureur \n\ngénéral), 2018 CAF 69 au para 54 [Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique Limitée], citant \n\nl’arrêt Eagle’s Nest Youth Ranch Inc v Corman Park (Rural Municipality #344), 2016 SKCA \n\n20 au para 20; voir aussi Canadian Hardwood Plywood and Veneer Association v Canada \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 14 \n\n(Attorney General), 2023 CAF 74 au para 57). La Cour doit ainsi se demander si la procédure est \n\néquitable compte tenu de toutes les circonstances (Chemin de fer Canadian Pacifique Limitée aux \n\npara 54-56). \n\nB. Position des parties \n\n[32] M. Moustaid soulève certains arguments en lien avec les décisions du CCIC et qui ne \n\nconcernent pas la Décision contestée du Comité d’appel. Puisque la Cour siège uniquement en \n\nrévision judiciaire de la Décision contestée, le présent jugement se limitera aux arguments \n\nprésentés en lien avec la Décision contestée qui peuvent être résumés comme suit : \n\na. La recommandation du Comité d’appel à l’encontre du CCIC de s’assurer à l’avenir \n\nque ses décisions indiquent le droit d’appel et le délai pour le faire est insuffisant \n\npour lui rappeler de respecter ses obligations minimales d’équité procédurale. Le \n\nComité d’appel aurait plutôt dû annuler la Décision en révocation; \n\nb. Le Comité d’appel a erré en fait et en droit en omettant d’analyser plusieurs des \n\nmotifs invoqués tant dans son avis d’appel daté du 22 août 2023 que dans sa \n\ndéclaration sous serment modifiée datée du 16 octobre 2023 relativement aux \n\nerreurs contenues dans la Décision en révocation, soit : \n\ni. L’absence de mention du caractère permanent de la révocation du permis; \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 15 \n\nii. L’absence de mention du droit d’appel et du délai pour en user; \n\niii. L’indication de la mauvaise date de l’avis final de paiement; et \n\niv. L’invocation du mauvais article du Règlement dans la Décision en \n\nrévocation (paragraphes 2.11 à 2.15 de l’avis d’appel); \n\nc. Le Comité d’appel a erré en droit en appliquant une seule norme d’intervention \n\nquant à la Décision en réadhésion, plutôt que d’appliquer une norme d’intervention \n\npar motif invoqué. Il ajoute que le Comité d’appel a invoqué à tort l’arrêt Vavilov \n\nlequel porte sur la norme de contrôle judiciaire, plutôt que d’invoquer l’arrêt \n\nHousen c Nikolaisen, 2002 CSC 33 [Housen], lequel porte sur la norme d’appel; \n\nd. Le Comité d’appel a complètement évacué les motifs invoqués aux paragraphes \n\n2.21 à 2.28 de son avis d’appel portant sur l’application de l’article 6.3 du \n\nRèglement sur la démission d’un CRIC plutôt que sur l’article 13.2 du Règlement; \n\ne. Le Comité d’appel a erré en fait et en droit en concluant qu’il n’était pas clair que \n\nM. Mousaid avait fait une demande de réinscription puisqu’il n’y a aucune mention \n\nd’une telle demande dans la Décision en réadhésion. Il ajoute que les paragraphes \n\n2.21 à 2.34 de l’avis d’appel portant sur son éligibilité sans conditions \n\nadditionnelles à son adhésion au titre de titulaire de permis de CRIC, n’ont pas du \n\ntout été abordés par le Comité d’appel. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 16 \n\n[33] Au niveau des dépens, bien que dans son mémoire des faits et du droit M. Moustaid a fait \n\nvaloir que le Comité d’appel n’a pas observé un principe de justice naturelle ou d’équité \n\nprocédurale en incluant parmi les dépens les frais de traducteur alors que le CCIC ne les demandait \n\npas, cet argument a été retiré lors de l’audition, M. Moustaid confirmant que lesdits frais n’avaient \n\npas été inclus dans les dépens. Il soumet toutefois puisque le Comité d’appel lui a donné raison \n\nque le droit d’appel n’était pas mentionné dans la Décision en révocation, il est inconcevable de \n\nlui faire assumer les frais d’avocat du CCIC. \n\n[34] Pour sa part, au niveau de la Décision en révocation soumise au Comité d’appel, le CCIC \n\nfait valoir qu’il n’y a aucun manquement aux principes de l’équité procédurale lors de la procédure \n\ndevant le Comité d’appel. Le CCIC souligne que M.°Moustaid semble contester le fond de la \n\ndécision plutôt que la procédure par laquelle le Comité d’appel est parvenu à la Décision contestée. \n\nLe CCIC soumet que le Comité d’appel a déterminé que M. Moustaid avait été dûment avisé de la \n\nrévocation et que la Décision de révocation était valide après avoir examiné le dossier factuel, ce \n\nqui commande la retenue. \n\n[35] Il ajoute que les « erreurs » alléguées par M. Moustaid qui auraient été contenues dans la \n\nDécision en révocation sont des arguments qui n’ont jamais été présentés au Comité d’appel. \n\n[36] Au niveau de la Décision en réadhésion également soumise au Comité d’appel, le CCIC \n\nsoumet que le Comité d’appel a adopté à juste titre les normes applicables en matière d’appel \n\ncomme énoncées par la Cour suprême dans Housen et que la référence à Vavilov était appropriée, \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 17 \n\ncar cette décision confirme que les normes de contrôle énoncées dans l’arrêt Housen s’applique \n\nlorsque le législateur prévoit un appel dans un contexte administratif. \n\n[37] Le CCIC soumet également que la conclusion du Comité d’appel à l’effet que M. Moustaid \n\nn’avait pas spécifiquement demandé sa réadhésion est une conclusion factuelle qui ne doit pas être \n\nréévaluée en l’absence de circonstances exceptionnelles. En l’espèce, il était approprié pour le \n\nComité d’appel de conclure qu’il serait « prématuré » de décider de l’éligibilité de M. Moustaid à \n\nune exemption aux exigences de scolarité. D’abondant, cette conclusion ne cause aucun préjudice \n\nà M. Moustaid puisqu’il est libre de présenter une demande d’exemption claire au CCIC et de \n\nrecevoir une décision définitive sur cette question. \n\n[38] Enfin, au niveau de la décision sur les dépens, le CCIC soumet que le pouvoir d’attribuer \n\ndes dépens est un acte discrétionnaire qui appelle à une grande déférence. À l’audience, le CCIC \n\na souligné que M.°Moustaid invoquait pour la première fois des arguments concernant l’accès à la \n\njustice, l’étendue du dossier et le caractère d’intérêt public de sa démarche, des arguments qui \n\nn’ont jamais été présentés au décideur administratif, bien qu’il ait eu l’occasion de le faire. En tout \n\nétat de cause, le CCIC souligne que le Comité d’appel n’a pas manqué à son obligation d’équité \n\nprocédurale dans l’attribution des dépens puisque cette décision a été prise après que les parties \n\nont eu pleinement l’occasion de présenter leurs observations. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 18 \n\nC. La Décision contestée est déraisonnable \n\n[39] D’entrée de jeu, la Cour est d’opinion que le processus suivi par le CCIC était adéquat et \n\nrespectait les principes d’équité procédurale. Les nombreux avis transmis à M. Moustaid à son \n\nadresse électronique habituelle étaient suffisants. M. Moustaid se devait de respecter les paiements \n\nde sa cotisation s’il désirait demeurer membre du CCIC. \n\n[40] La Cour en accord avec le CCIC que la question de la réception ou non, des divers avis \n\npréalables à la Décision de révocation était au cœur du litige. Malgré les prétentions de \n\nM. Moustaid qu’il n’a pas reçu certains de ces avis, le Comité d’appel n’a pas retenu cette \n\nprétention. Sur la base de l’ensemble de la preuve devant le Comité d’appel, cette Cour considère \n\nque cette conclusion du Comité d’appel n’était pas déraisonnable. \n\n[41] La décision du Comité d’appel quant à l’argument de M. Moustaid à l’effet que les avis du \n\nCCIC auraient dû l’informer de son droit d’appel et des délais pour ce faire n’est également pas \n\ndéraisonnable. Les informations nécessaires étaient disponibles dans le Règlement et bien que la \n\nCour partage l’avis du Comité d’appel qu’il serait préférable à l’avenir que les avis fournissent les \n\ninformations pertinentes à ce sujet, ceux-ci remplissaient les conditions requises pour être valables \n\net opposables à M. Moustaid. \n\n[42] Toutefois, M. Moustaid a soulevé d’autres arguments devant le Comité d’appel en lien \n\navec la Décision de révocation qui n’ont pas été adressés par le Comité d’appel. Bien que le Comité \n\nd’appel n’eût pas à traiter de l’ensemble de ceux-ci, pour que la décision soit jugée raisonnable, le \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 19 \n\nComité d’appel se devait d’aborder les arguments principaux formulés par M.°Moustaid (Vavilov \n\nau para 128). \n\n(1) Erreurs dans le contenu de la Décision en révocation \n\n[43] Parmi ses arguments principaux, M. Moustaid soulève le fait que la Décision contestée \n\nn’adresse pas le fait que la Décision en révocation du 8 juillet 2022 indique erronément être basée \n\nsur l’article 20.6 du Règlement. À la lecture de cet article, M.°Moustaid soumet qu’il était bien \n\nfondé de croire qu’un délai de 90 jours à compter de l’avis de suspension était applicable avant \n\nque son permis ne puisse être révoqué. \n\n[44] En effet, même si le Comité d’appel était d’avis que M. Moustaid avait reçu l’avis de \n\nsuspension le 6 juin 2022, puisque la Décision en révocation faisait spécifiquement référence à \n\nl’article 20.6 du Règlement, en vertu dudit article son permis ne pouvait être révoqué avant le 3 \n\nseptembre 2022 : \n\n20.6 Pouvoir supplémentaire quant à la révocation  \n\nSi la suspension du permis d’un titulaire de permis en vertu de \nl’article 20 se poursuit au-delà de quatre-vingt-dix (90) jours, le \nregistraire peut révoquer le permis du titulaire de permis; un avis de \nrévocation sera envoyé au titulaire de permis selon la forme prévue \nà l’article 5 l’informant que son permis a été révoqué conformément \naux Règlements administratifs et lui demandant de retourner son \ncertificat d’adhésion et sa pièce d’identité à photo, si une telle pièce \nlui a été délivrée. \n\n[emphase ajoutée.] \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 20 \n\n[45] Puisqu’il a payé les cotisations dues avant le délai de 90 jours prévu à l’article 20.6 du \n\nRèglement, M. Moustaid pouvait raisonnablement s’attendre que la révocation de son permis soit \n\nannulée. \n\n[46] D’abondant, la Décision en révocation n’indique pas que la date de l’avis de suspension \n\nétait le 6 juin 2022, mais réfère erronément au fait qu’un avis final de paiement aurait été envoyé \n\nle 6 juin 2022 : \n\nNos dossiers indiquent qu’un avis final de paiement daté du 6 juin \n2022 vous a été envoyé concernant les montants payables au Collège \ndes consultants en immigration et en citoyenneté (Collège), et que \nvous n’avez ni effectué le ou les paiements requis ni pris les autres \nmesures précisées dans ledit avis. \n\nPar conséquent, votre permis du Collège est révoqué avec effet \nimmédiat, conformément au paragraphe 20.6 du Règlement \nadministratif 2021-2.  \n\n[emphase ajoutée.] \n\n[47] De fait, la Décision en révocation ne contient aucune mention d’un avis de suspension \n\nquelconque. \n\n[48] Par ailleurs, M. Moustaid soumet que le CCIC aurait dû baser son avis sur l’article 20.4 du \n\nRèglement, et dans un tel cas, le CCIC devait attendre un délai minimal de 60 jours après l’envoi \n\nde l’avis final de paiement avant de révoquer son permis. Encore ici, le paiement requis ayant été \n\nfait avant l’expiration de ce délai de 60 jours calculé à partir du 6 juin 2022, M. Moustaid soumet \n\nqu’il pouvait raisonnablement s’attendre que la révocation de son permis soit annulée. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 21 \n\n[49] Peu importe l’article du Règlement applicable, soit 20.4 ou 20.6, ces erreurs dans la \n\nDécision en révocation n’étaient pas sans conséquence sur le calcul des délais et la compréhension \n\nde M. Moustaid quant à ses droits. Les arguments soulevés en lien avec ces erreurs auraient dû \n\nêtre considérés par le Comité d’appel et l’absence d’explication sur ces éléments rend la Décision \n\ncontestée déraisonnable. \n\n(2) La Décision contestée ne traite pas de sa demande d’annulation de la Décision en \nrévocation de son permis \n\n[50] Deuxièmement, M. Moustaid soutient que le CCIC n’aurait pas traité sa demande d’annuler \n\nla Décision en révocation, pour ne considérer que sa demande subsidiaire de réadhésion, le tout \n\nsans explication. Encore ici, la Décision contestée est silencieuse quant à cet argument de \n\nM.°Moustaid. Ceci est particulièrement important puisque dans le contexte d’une réadhésion, \n\ncertains critères d’éligibilité entraient potentiellement en jeu alors que cela n’aurait pas été le cas \n\ndans le contexte d’une annulation de la révocation de son permis. Encore ici, le silence du Comité \n\nd’appel sur cet argument rend la Décision contestée déraisonnable.  \n\n[51] Vu ce qui précède, il n’y a pas lieu d’adresser les autres arguments de M. Moustaid. \n\n[52] Toutefois, la Cour se permet d’ajouter qu’elle est d’accord que le CCIC n’avait pas à \n\ndécider si M. Moustaid remplissait les critères d’éligibilité requis pour une réadhésion et donc, \n\nqu’il n’était pas déraisonnable pour le Comité d’appel de juger que cette question était prématurée. \n\nCela dit, M. Moustaid a indiqué lors de l’audition qu’à la face même de son dossier au CCIC, il \n\napparait qu’il remplit les exceptions d’éligibilité puisqu’il a complété son EAP auprès du CCIC au \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 22 \n\ncours des trois dernières années. Ces faits n’ayant pas été présentés ni au CCIC, ni au Comité \n\nd’appel, la Cour n’en tiendra pas compte si ce n’est que pour inviter le Comité d’appel, si cette \n\ninformation est vraie, à en tenir compte lors de la révision du dossier de M. Moustaid. \n\nD. Commentaire en obiter sur la norme d’appel appliquée par le Comité d’appel \n\n[53] M. Moustaid soumet que le Comité d’appel a invoqué à tort l’arrêt Vavilov, lequel porte \n\nsur les normes de contrôle judiciaire, plutôt que d’invoquer l’arrêt Housen, lequel porte sur les \n\nnormes d’appel. L’article 30.3 du Règlement indique que « le Comité d’appel a le pouvoir de \n\ndisposer de toute question de droit ou combinant droit et fait qui surgit en appel ». Bien qu’il soit \n\nvrai que le Comité d’appel fait référence à tort à l’arrêt Vavilov, plutôt qu’à l’arrêt dans la décision \n\nHousen, la Cour est d’accord avec le CCIC que cette question n’était pas déterminante en \n\nl’instance. En effet, il est évident à la lecture de la Décision contestée que le Comité d’appel a \n\neffectivement appliqué les normes d’appel établies dans Housen, tel que souligné par le CCIC dans \n\nson mémoire. Cela se révèle notamment par la terminologie utilisée dans les paragraphes 32, 33 et \n\n37 de la Décision contestée du 7 février 2024. \n\nVI. Conclusion \n\n[54] Pour les motifs ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire de M. Moustaid est accueillie. \n\nLa Décision contestée ne possède pas tous les attributs requis de transparence, de justification et \n\nd’intelligibilité requis en vertu de la norme de la décision raisonnable (Vavilov au para 99). La \n\nDécision est entachée d’erreurs ou lacunes graves justifiant l’intervention de la Cour (Vavilov aux \n\npara 100–101). \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 23 \n\n[55] Par ailleurs, dans la mesure où il est vrai que le CCIC a conservé les versements faits par \n\nM. Moustaid en juillet 2022, ces sommes devront être considérées lors de la révision du dossier de \n\nM.°Moustaid. Il serait incongru que le CCIC conserve les versements faits sur un permis que la \n\nCCIC affirme être révoqué. \n\n[56] Puisque la Décision contestée inclut la décision en lien avec les dépens, et puisque cette \n\ndernière est directement liée à l’issue de la redétermination, la question des dépens devra \n\négalement être réévaluée par le Comité d’appel. \n\n[57] Quant aux dépens en lien avec le présent contrôle judiciaire, les parties se sont entendues \n\nque la partie ayant gain de cause recevrait des dépens de 3 500 $ à l’autre. La Cour ne voit pas de \n\nmotif de contredire cette entente. Ainsi, le CCIC devra verser à M. Moustaid la somme de 3 500 $ \n\npour ses dépens. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page : 24 \n\nJUGEMENT au dossier T-506-24 \n\nLA COUR STATUE que : \n\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accordée. \n\n2. La Décision contestée est retournée au Comité d’appel pour redétermination en \n\nconformité avec les motifs de ce jugement. \n\n3. Des dépens de 3 500$ sont adjugés en faveur de M. Moustaid. \n\n« Danielle Ferron » \nJuge \n\n \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n \n\nCOUR FÉDÉRALE \n\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER \n\nDOSSIER : T-506-24 \n\nINTITULÉ : CHAFIK MOUSTAID c COLLÈGE DES \nCONSULTANTS EN IMMIGRATION ET EN \nCITOYENNETÉ (CCIC) \n\nLIEU DE L’AUDIENCE : MONTRÉAL (QUÉBEC) \n\nDATE DE L’AUDIENCE : LE 12 MAI 2025 \n\nJUGEMENT ET MOTIFS : FERRON J. \n\nDATE DES MOTIFS : LE 3 JUIN 2025 \n\nCOMPARUTIONS : \n\nChafik Moustaid POUR LE DEMANDEUR \n(POUR SON PROPRE COMPTE) \n\nMe Gregory Ko POUR LE DÉFENDEUR \nKasner Ko LLP CONSULTANTS EN IMMIGRATION ET EN \n\nCITOYENNETÉ (CCIC) \n\nAVOCATS INSCRITS AU DOSSIER : \n\nMe Gregory Ko POUR LE DÉFENDEUR \nKasner Ko LLP \n\n \n\n \n\n2025 CF 1006 (CanLII)"

Aperçu et résumé des faits pertinents \n\n[1] Le demandeur est citoyen guinéen qui a reçu l'ordre de se présenter pour son renvoi du \n\nCanada le 4 juin 2025. Il a demandé un report de son renvoi du Canada au motif qu'il souhaite \n\nprésenter une deuxième demande d'évaluation des risques avant renvoi [ERAR] parce qu'il a reçu \n\nune représentation inadéquate la première fois, ce qui a entraîné le rejet de sa demande. Dans le \n\ncadre de la nouvelle demande d'ERAR, il souhaiterait également fournir des preuves qui \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\ncorroboreraient le risque qu'il court de retourner dans son pays, tant en raison de son \n\nappartenance ethnique peule/fulani et de ses opinions politiques. Le demandeur fait valoir que, \n\npuisque l'avocat qui l'a représenté dans le cadre de l’ERAR a depuis été radié du barreau, il a été \n\nmal représenté et mérite de présenter une nouvelle ERAR. Toutefois, le 15 janvier 2024, la Cour \n\nfédérale a rejeté le contrôle judiciaire de la décision ERAR (IMM-8302-23). \n\n[2] Le demandeur ne conteste pas le fait qu'il est citoyen guinéen et qu'il n'a pas d'autre \n\nnationalité. Il conteste toutefois le fait que les autorités canadiennes puissent le renvoyer en \n\nGuinée avec un passeport expiré. \n\n[3] Dans sa demande de report de son renvoi, il a demandé à l'agent chargé de l'examen de \n\nreporter son renvoi jusqu'à ce que diverses décisions soient prises, notamment concernant sa \n\ndemande humanitaire et compassionnelle en instance, ou jusqu'à ce que son permis de séjour \n\ntemporaire soit délivré, ou encore jusqu'à ce que les autorités américaines chargées de \n\nl'immigration se prononcent sur sa demande d'immigration. \n\n[4] L'agent d'exécution chargé d'examiner la demande de report a refusé le report le 27 mai \n\n2025. Le demandeur demande maintenant à cette Cour de rendre une ordonnance suspendant le \n\nrefus en attendant la décision finale sur sa demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire \n\n[DACJ] de la Décision. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\n[5] J'ai déclaré à la fin de l'audience que je rejetterais la demande de sursis car je n’étais pas \n\nconvaincu que le demandeur eût satisfait au critère en trois parties pour un sursis. J'ai également \n\ndéclaré que mes raisons suivraient. Ce sont ces raisons. \n\nII. Analyse \n\nA. Le test pour un sursis à l'expulsion \n\n[6] Une suspension de l’exécution d’une mesure de renvoi constitue un remède \n\nextraordinaire et discrétionnaire en « equity », qui exige des circonstances spéciales et \n\nconvaincantes (Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l’Immigration) c Harkat, 2006 CAF \n\n215 au para 10). Le demandeur doit satisfaire le test tripartite établi par la Cour suprême du \n\nCanada [CSC] dans RJR-Macdonald Inc c Canada (Procureur général), 1994 CanLII 117 \n\n(CSC), [1994] 1 RCS 311 [RJR-MacDonald] pour l’émission d’injonctions interlocutoires et de \n\nsursis, et appliqué par la Cour d’appel fédérale [CAF] aux sursis de renvois en matière \n\nd’immigration dans Toth c Canada (Citoyenneté et Immigration) (1988), 1988 CanLII 1420 \n\n(CAF), 86 NR 302 (CAF) [Toth]. \n\n[7] Ce test tripartite exige que le demandeur démontre à la Cour : i) qu’il existe une question \n\nsérieuse à trancher suite à une analyse préliminaire du mérite de la DACJ sous-jacente à leur \n\nrequête; ii) que le demandeur subira un préjudice irréparable s’il est renvoyée du Canada en \n\nGuinée ; et iii) que la prépondérance des inconvénients joue en sa faveur (R c Société Radio-\n\nCanada, 2018 CSC 5 au para 12 [SRC]). La décision d’accorder ou de refuser un sursis ou une \n\ninjonction interlocutoire est discrétionnaire (SRC au para 27). \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\n[8] Tel que la Cour suprême l’a affirmé dans Google Inc c Equustek Solutions Inc, 2017 CSC \n\n34 [Google], la question fondamentale est « essentiellement de savoir si l’octroi d’une injonction \n\nest juste et équitable eu égard à l’ensemble des circonstances de l’affaire », ce qui « dépendra \n\nnécessairement du contexte » (Google au para 25). \n\n[9] Le test de l’arrêt RJR-MacDonald est conjonctif et il faut satisfaire à chacun de ses trois \n\nvolets pour que la réparation recherchée soit accordée. Aucun des volets du test ne saurait \n\nêtre « facultatif » (Janssen Inc c Abbvie Corporation, 2014 CAF 112 au para 19 [Janssen]), et le \n\n« défaut de satisfaire à l’un ou l’autre des trois éléments du critère est fatal » (Canada \n\n(Citoyenneté et Immigration) c Ishaq, 2015 CAF 212 au para 15; Canada (Patrimoine) c \n\n9616934 Canada Inc, 2023 CAF 141 au para 11; Western Oilfield Equipment Rentals Ltd c M-I \n\nLLC, 2020 CAF 3 au para 7 [Western Oilfield]). Cela dit, les trois volets du critère sont \n\ninterreliés, et ils ne devraient pas être évalués de façon isolée (The Regents of University of \n\nCalifornia c I-Med Pharma Inc, 2016 CF 606 au para 27, conf par 2017 CAF 8; Merck & Co Inc \n\nc Nu-Pharm Inc, (2000), 2000 CanLII 14758 (CF), 4 CPR (4e) 464 (CF) au para 13). Cela ne \n\nsignifie toutefois pas que l’un des compartiments puisse être entièrement vide et compensé par \n\nles deux autres étant remplis à des niveaux élevés. En bout de piste, la Cour doit être convaincue \n\nque chacune des branches du test est satisfaite et aucun des trois volets ne peut être totalement \n\nlaissé de côté et rescapé par les deux autres. Ainsi, si le demandeur échoue sur l’un ou l’autre des \n\néléments du test tripartite, sa demande de sursis doit être rejetée. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\n[10] La Cour évalue ces facteurs et exerce son pouvoir discrétionnaire en tenant compte de \n\ntous les faits pertinents et détermine si l’octroi du sursis serait juste et équitable eu égard à \n\nl’ensemble des circonstances de l’affaire : Google, aux paras 1 et 25. \n\n(1) Question sérieuse \n\n[11] Comme dans ce cas, lorsqu’un sursis est demandé dans l’attente d’une décision sur une \n\ndemande de contrôle judiciaire d’un refus de reporter une mesure de renvoi, l’octroi du sursis \n\naccorde en pratique à le demandeur la réparation sollicitée, et que l’exigence relative à la \n\n« question sérieuse » n’est satisfaite dans de tels cas que si, après avoir « examiné \n\nattentivement » les questions, la Cour estime que le demandeur a présenté des « arguments assez \n\nsolides » ou a démontré qu’il est « vraisemblable que la demande principale soit accueillie », en \n\nreconnaissant que la norme de contrôle est celle de la décision raisonnable : Baron c Canada \n\n(Ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile), 2009 CAF 81 aux para 51 et 66 à 67, \n\ncitant Wang c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l’Immigration), 2001 CFPI 148 aux \n\npara 8 à10; Gill c Canada (Sécurité publique et Protection civile), 2020 CF 1075 aux para 20 \n\nà24; Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l’Immigration) c Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 aux \n\npara 16 à17 et 23 à25. \n\n[12] Les parties ne contestent pas que le demandeur soit visé par une mesure de renvoi \n\nexécutoire ou que l’agent a l'obligation, en vertu du paragraphe 48(2) de la Loi sur l'immigration \n\net la protection des réfugiés, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR], d'exécuter une mesure de renvoi exécutoire \n\ndès que possible. Bien qu'elles conviennent que le pouvoir discrétionnaire de l'agent de reporter \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\nle renvoi est limité et restreint à un report temporaire et à court terme, elles ne s'entendent pas sur \n\nle caractère raisonnable de la décision de l'agent de ne pas reporter le renvoi dans cette affaire. \n\n[13] Dans ce cas, les constatations de l'agent sur lesquelles sa conclusion est fondée sont \n\nclaires. L'agent commence par exposer les antécédents du demandeur en matière d'immigration \n\net indique qu'il examine la demande de report à la lumière de son obligation et du pouvoir \n\ndiscrétionnaire limité que lui confère le paragraphe 48(2) de la LIPR. Il note à juste titre que la \n\nseule décision en instance devant la Cour fédérale était son refus verbal de reporter le renvoi et \n\nqu'en vertu de l'article 165 du Règlement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, \n\nDORS/2002-227[RIPR], un nouvel ERAR n'offrirait pas de sursis légal au renvoi. \n\n[14] Le demandeur avait également fait valoir que son renvoi en Guinée avant qu'une \n\névaluation des risques bien documentée ait été effectuée rendrait toute évaluation des risques \n\npotentiels sans objet. Cependant, l'agent a appliqué raisonnablement la loi en s'appuyant sur \n\nl'arrêt Shpati c Canada, 2011 CAF 286, aux paras 34 et 35, pour rejeter l'argument du demandeur \n\nsur le caractère sans objet. \n\n[15] L'agent a également souligné que les demandes d'ERAR et d'entrée et de séjour pour \n\nconsidérations humanitaires présentées par le demandeur avaient déjà été rejetées, la Cour \n\nfédérale ayant refusé le contrôle judiciaire des deux demandes. L'agent a clairement expliqué \n\npourquoi une nouvelle demande d'entrée et de séjour pour considérations humanitaires datée du \n\n26 juillet 2024 et présentée par l'épouse américaine du demandeur, qui avait inscrit ce dernier \n\ncomme conjoint le 26 juillet 2024, n'était pas suffisante pour suspendre le renvoi. L'agent a \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nrenvoyé à un document de politique qui stipulait directement que de telles demandes n'auraient \n\naucune incidence sur la procédure de renvoi. De manière tout aussi raisonnable, l'agent a \n\nexaminé l'argument du demandeur visant à reporter le renvoi jusqu'à ce qu'une décision soit \n\nrendue sur le permis de séjour temporaire et a fourni des motifs rationnellement liés à sa \n\ndécision. \n\n[16] Je conclus également que l'agent a raisonnablement décidé de ne pas réexaminer le bien-\n\nfondé de la demande pour considérations humanitaires à ce stade, conformément à l'arrêt \n\nChetaru c Canada (Sécurité publique et Protection civile), 2009 CF 436, aux paras 17 à 19. \n\n[17] L'agent a également examiné attentivement l'argument du demandeur qui souhaitait \n\nattendre au Canada que son visa d'immigration américain soit traité et, sur la base des éléments \n\ndont il disposait, il a conclu raisonnablement que rien ne suggérait que son renvoi du Canada \n\naurait une incidence sur ce traitement. \n\n[18] Finalement, l'agent a examiné les arguments et les éléments de preuve présentés par le \n\ndemandeur concernant le risque de retour en Guinée et les a analysés à la lumière des \n\nantécédents d'immigration du demandeur, y compris le fait que ce risque avait déjà été examiné \n\nen profondeur dans le cadre de l'ERAR. Il s'agissait là d'une analyse raisonnable. \n\n[19] Plus important encore, La DACJ sous-jacente a été déposée à l’encontre d’une prétendue \n\n« décision verbale » du 1er mai 2025 émise par un agent de l’ASFC refusant une deuxième \n\ndemande ÉRAR du demandeur. Il est sans équivoque que le demandeur n’a pas déposé de \n\ndeuxième demande ÉRAR et aucune décision n’a été rendue par un agent de l’ASFC à cet égard. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 8 \n\nLa DACJ est alors sans fondement et il n’y a donc pas de question sérieuse à trancher. \n\n[20] Le demandeur affirme que sa demande verbale a créé une obligation légale pour l'agent \n\nd'initier un deuxième ERAR. Lorsque j'ai demandé une référence juridique, le demandeur a \n\nreconnu qu'il n'y en avait pas, mais il a déclaré que cela faisait partie du principe d'équité \n\nprocédurale et de l'attente légitime du demandeur, comme l'a montré l'arrêt Baker c Canada \n\n(Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (CSC) [Baker]. J'ai conclu que \n\nl'invocation de l'arrêt Baker par le demandeur était déplacée, étant donné que le demandeur a eu \n\nl'occasion de présenter son risque dans le cadre de l'ERAR et que la seule raison pour laquelle il \n\nsouhaite une deuxième chance est qu'il n'a pas plaidé sa cause de manière exhaustive la première \n\nfois. S'attendre à un autre ERAR, alors que la Cour fédérale a également confirmé la décision \n\nnégative, n'est pas une attente légitime. Poursuivre l'argumentation du demandeur jusqu'à sa \n\nconclusion logique aboutira à des évaluations de risque illimitées chaque fois qu'un demandeur ne \n\nsera pas d'accord avec la conclusion négative. Cela imposera également une obligation injuste à \n\nl'agent d'exécution dont le travail consiste à ne pas procéder à une évaluation complète des risques \n\nlorsqu'une évaluation a déjà été effectuée. \n\n[21] Le demandeur ne conteste pas le fait qu'il est citoyen guinéen et qu'il n'a aucune autre \n\nnationalité. Il ne soutient pas non plus qu'il existe un litige quant à son identité. Il conteste \n\ntoutefois le fait que les autorités canadiennes puissent le renvoyer en Guinée avec un passeport \n\nexpiré. Je considère que l'exigence documentaire lui permettant d'arriver en Guinée n'est pas \n\npertinente au regard du critère juridique applicable à la suspension d'un renvoi, et j'estime qu'il \n\nétait raisonnable que l'agent ne s'y attarde pas. L'absence de passeport valide, lorsqu'il n'y a pas \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 9 \n\nde litige quant à l'identité de la personne renvoyée et au pays de destination, n'invalide pas la \n\nprocédure de renvoi. \n\n[22] Interrogé sur la pertinence de cet argument, le conseil du demandeur m'a renvoyé aux \n\nrègles générales fixées par l'IATA et à la lettre de l'ambassade de Guinée pour conclure qu'il n'est \n\npas possible de voyager avec un passeport expiré : \n\nJe soussigné, Alhassane DIABATÉ, Premier Secrétaire et Chargé \nd’Affaires a.i. à l’Ambassade de la République de Guinée au \nCanada atteste que l'Agence des Services frontaliers du Canada \n(ASFC) ne m’a pas contacté au sujet de Monsieur ABDOUL \nMAJID BAH. Aussi, voudrais-je préciser que le passeport de \nMonsieur BAH est encore en cours de traitement et les délais ne \nluis sont imputables. Par ailleurs, je voudrais affirmer que \nMonsieur BAH ne peut pas entrer en Guinée sans un passeport ou \nun titre de voyage en cours de validité. \n\nEn foi de quoi, la présente attestation lui a été délivrée pour servir \net valoir ce que de droit. \n\n[23] En l'absence d'autres éléments de preuve, le demandeur a fait valoir que cela signifierait \n\nqu'il serait détenu à son arrivée. Lorsqu'on lui a demandé pourquoi une procédure administrative \n\nqui pourrait inclure un interrogatoire supplémentaire pendant sa détention poserait un problème, \n\nle demandeur s'est contenté de contester la légalité de l'éloignement. Je ne dispose d'aucun \n\nélément permettant de déterminer si le demandeur sera détenu ou, dans l'affirmative, s'il sera \n\nvictime de mauvais traitements. Si les autorités doivent poser des questions supplémentaires en \n\nraison du passeport expiré, cela ne rend pas en soi le renvoi illégal.  \n\n[24] Sans préjuger le juge qui statuera en dernier ressort sur la demande d'autorisations, je \n\nconsidère que la décision est raisonnable et qu’elle ne soulève pas un problème sérieux au regard \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 10 \n\ndu motif plus élevé applicable en l'espèce. J'estime que le demandeur n’ait pas soulevé de \n\nquestion sérieuse dans cette affaire. \n\n(2) Préjudice irréparable \n\n[25] Le critère pour suspendre le renvoi est conjonctif, ce qui signifie que le demandeur doit \n\nétablir chaque élément. Cependant, je juge nécessaire de commenter également son échec à \n\nétablir l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable. \n\n[26] Thuraisingam c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration), 2006 CF 72 au \n\npara 13, a conclu que le préjudice irréparable est spécifique aux faits et que les demandeurs \n\ndoivent établir, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le préjudice est susceptible de se \n\nproduire. Les preuves doivent être crédibles et le préjudice non spéculatif.  \n\n[27] Le demandeur a fait l'objet d'une évaluation des risques dans le cadre d'une décision \n\nd'ERAR qui a été examinée par la Cour fédérale et confirmée. C'est à cette occasion que le \n\ndemandeur a pu faire valoir ses arguments concernant l'incompétence de son ancien avocat. C'est \n\ndans ce contexte que l'agent a évalué les arguments fondés sur le risque et les a rejetés. Il était \n\nraisonnable que l'agent ne spécule pas sur le risque auquel le demandeur serait exposé dans les \n\ncirconstances. \n\n[28] Comme expliqué ci-dessus, le demandeur n'a pas fourni de preuves suffisantes que son \n\nretour avec un passeport expiré créerait pour lui des conditions qui équivaudraient à un préjudice \n\nirréparable. \n\n \n\n2025 CF 998 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 11 \n\n[29] Le préjudice économique invoqué par le demandeur est insuffisant et le demandeur n’a \n\npas présenté une preuve convaincante que son renvoi causera un préjudice irréparable d’ordre \n\néconomique. Il ne détient pas de permis de travail alors il ne peut pas travailler au Canada. Le \n\ndemandeur ne démontre pas comment son renvoi aura des effets économiques au-delà des effets \n\nmalheureux qui découlent inévitablement d’un renvoi, qui ne sont pas suffisants pour établir un \n\npréjudice irréparable (Mann v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 \n\nCanLII 33981 (FC)).  \n\n(3) Balance des inconvénients \n\n[30] En l’absence d’une question sérieuse à trancher et de préjudice irréparable, la \n\nprépondérance des inconvénients penche en faveur de l’intérêt public (Maganga c Canada \n\n(Citoyenneté et Immigration), 2007 CF 94 aux paras 43 à44). En plus, la partie défenderesse a le \n\ndevoir d'exécuter les ordres de renvoi dès que possible en vertu de l'article 48(2) de la LIPR, et je \n\nconclus que l'intérêt public favorise le renvoi vers le pays.  \n\nIII. Conclusion \n\n[31] Après avoir pesé tous les éléments pertinents, le demandeur n’a pas satisfait au critère en \n\ntrois parties d'un sursis à l'exécution de la mesure de renvoi. \n\n[32] Je rejette la demande de suspension de renvoi présentée par le demandeur.

The Application was refused because the Officer was not satisfied that \n\nMs. Eisapour would leave Canada at the end of her authorized stay, pursuant to \n\nparagraph 216(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\nSOR/2002-227 [IRPR]. By extension, the Officer also denied the dependent applications of the \n\nco-applicants, Ms. Eisapour’s husband and daughter. For the reasons that follow, this application \n\nfor judicial review is dismissed. \n\n[2] By way of a brief background, Ms. Eisapour is a Regulatory and Scientific Affairs \n\nSpecialist and has a bachelor’s degree in Food Science and Technology. She applied to come to \n\nCanada with her spouse and child in order to pursue a Master of Administrative Science: Global \n\nLeadership and Administration, at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Vancouver, British \n\nColumbia. \n\n[3] The Officer refused Ms. Eisapour’s Application by letter dated February 9, 2024, because \n\nthey were not satisfied that she would leave Canada at the end of her stay as required by \n\nparagraph 216(1)(b) of the IRPR due to (i) the lack of her significant family ties outside of \n\nCanada, and (ii) the purpose of her stay was inconsistent with a temporary stay. \n\n[4] Ms. Eisapour’s main argument is that the Decision is unreasonable because the Officer \n\ndid not provide adequate reasons for refusal in regard to the purpose of her visit, her lack of \n\nfamily ties and the study plan/career goals. Ms. Eisapour also contends that the Officer breached \n\nher right to procedural fairness because the Officer’s concerns were not related to the \n\nApplication submitted – but rather whether she would depart the country at the end of her \n\nstudies, which she contends should have been raised through a procedural fairness letter. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\n[5] The Respondent counters that the Decision is reasonable in light of the evidence filed \n\nwith the Application, and that the Officer breached no duty of fairness. \n\n[6] I agree with the latter point. Indeed, the Applicant resiled from the fairness argument at \n\nthe hearing. As a result, the sole issue that remains is whether the Decision to refuse \n\nMs. Eisapour’s study permit Application is reasonable (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \n\nImmigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 15 [Vavilov]). \n\n[7] This Court has repeatedly held that visa officers (1) have wide discretion in assessing the \n\nevidence to determine whether legislative requirements are met by applicants; (2) are presumed \n\nto have considered all the evidence before them even if they do not explicitly refer to each \n\ndocument; and (3) should be afforded a significant degree of deference for factual findings (see \n\nMehrjoo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 886 at paras 6–7, 16 [Mehrjoo]; \n\nBahrami v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 957 at para 3 [Bahrami]; Shahani v \n\nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 111 at para 16). \n\n[8] In this case, the Officer indicated that Ms. Eisapour’s family ties to Iran were \n\n“weaken[ed]” because her husband and their daughter would be coming to Canada with her. As \n\nexplained in Nourani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 732 at paras 23–26 \n\n[Nourani], this factor can reasonably be considered by an Officer in assessing ties to a country of \n\nresidence, although it may not be sufficient as the sole reason to deny an applicant’s study permit \n\n(see also, Bahrami at para 4). \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\n[9] Ms. Eisapour takes issue with the Officer’s appreciation of her study plan and career \n\nprogression, noting that the Officer’s conclusion was not justified and was unreasonable in light \n\nof the record. However, the applicant bears the onus to convince the visa officer of the merits of \n\nthe study plan, and failing to do so undermines an applicant’s ability to establish the purpose of \n\ntheir visit and to show that they intend to comply with paragraph 216(1)(b) of the Immigration \n\nand Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] (Mehrjoo at paras 12–13, 15). Furthermore, \n\nan officer can reasonably conclude that an applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed \n\ncourse of study makes sense, considering (a) previous education or employment, or (b) when \n\npresented with a vague and general study plan (see, for instance, Rezaye Yazdi v Canada \n\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 1221 at para 14). \n\n[10] Ms. Eisapour also takes issue with the Officer’s overall conclusion that the purpose of her \n\nvisit is not consistent with her Application, pointing to her admission and Study Plan. \n\nSpecifically, she points to the two paragraphs of her Study Plan in which she sets out her \n\nobjectives: \n\nMy decision to pursue a Master’s in Administrative Science with a \nfocus on Global Leadership and Administration is fueled by over \n12 years of experience in the dynamic field of the food industry. I \nam dedicated to elevating my career, and I strongly believe that \nthis program will equip me with a comprehensive understanding of \ninternational business, politics, and administration. This global \nperspective is particularly valuable in today's interconnected world \nwhere organizations operate across borders, and leaders must \nnavigate diverse cultural, economic, and political landscapes.  \n\nUpon completion of my study, I am committed to returning to Iran \nand applying my knowledge and skills in the field of Food and \nTechnology. With a strong foundation in marketing and finance, I \nam confident in my ability to lead strategic initiatives within a \nmultinational corporation. Additionally, I am excited about the \nprospect of establishing my own venture, focusing on sustainable \nand innovative solutions tailored to the unique needs of the Iranian \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\nmarket. My international exposure, combined with a deep \nunderstanding of local dynamics, positions me to make a \nsignificant impact on the business ecosystem, fostering economic \ngrowth and creating employment opportunities in Iran. \n\n[11] The Officer acknowledged Ms. Eisapour’s first degree in Food Science and Technology, \n\nand that she had been working as a Regulatory and Scientific Affairs Specialist, but noted there \n\nwas little indication from her previous studies and/or employment that this intended program was \n\na necessary progression in her career path. For instance, the Officer noted that her employer \n\nmade no mention of any advantage to be gained by pursuing this further degree, or promotion \n\noffered after its conclusion. \n\n[12] The Officer, as a further point, also noted that in planning to come with her immediate \n\nfamily, her ties to Iran – and her motivation to return there – would diminish. These findings are \n\njustifiable and intelligible given the lack of evidence. \n\n[13] Just prior to the hearing, Ms. Eisapour added four cases on which she relied, namely \n\nMomeni v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 1436 [Momeni]; Farhadi v. Canada \n\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2025 FC 917 [Farhadi]; Roudehchianahmadi v Canada \n\n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 626; and Nourani. However, these cases are all \n\ndistinguishable, because the applicants had provided more meaningful evidence, including noting \n\nstronger family ties in their country of residence, and a demonstration of the benefit to their \n\nstudy plan to their careers. In each case, the officer failed to grapple with the evidence. Here, \n\nhowever, Ms. Eisapour did not furnish this evidence with her Application. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\n[14] The Applicant stressed that the principal case upon which she relied is Nourani. The facts \n\nare indeed very similar to the case at bar, in that the two issues considered in Nourani were the \n\nfamily ties of the applicant in Iran and the sufficiency of the study plan. \n\n[15] First, Justice Gascon found that because the applicant’s husband (her most important \n\nfamily tie) was to accompany her to Canada, “it was open to the Officer to determine that \n\nMs. Nourani was left with weaker family ties in Iran” (at para 24). I am of the view that the same \n\nobservation holds true in the present case. \n\n[16] Second, however, there were marked factual differences, including specificity in the \n\napplicant’s study plan, as well as specifics contained in the employment letter which mentioned \n\npossible progress in Ms. Nourani’s employment upon the conclusion of studies. Moreover – and \n\nwhat was crucial in Justice Gascon’s view – was that the officer ignored specific details of the \n\napplicant’s intentions to start an entrepreneurship in Iran upon her return. Justice Gascon noted \n\nthat the applicant had made several mentions of her intentions to start a business and how she \n\nplanned to use the knowledge from the program to do so, as this was her “biggest goal” (at \n\npara 36). Justice Gascon held at paragraph 32, that “the Officer’s reasons on Ms. Nourani’s study \n\nplan leave the distinct impression that the Officer did not actually listen to or read Ms. Nourani’s \n\nsubmissions in support of her study permit.” \n\n[17] The same cannot be said in this case. Ms. Eisapour’s submissions and supporting \n\nevidence, including her study plan, were replete with generalities and lacked the specificity that \n\nJustice Gascon pointed to, and that the prospective student presented to the officer in Nourani. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nHere, for instance, the Applicant failed to provide any details of how the degree would improve \n\nher employment prospects, and simply provided a confirmation of employment. Her employer \n\nstated nothing about her future studies in Canada. Furthermore, while Ms. Eisapour alluded to \n\nfuture entrepreneurship in her Study Plan (see extract above), she only briefly mentioned the \n\n“prospect of establishing [her] own venture,” without any further details, plans, or specifics as to \n\nhow this would occur. \n\n[18] Ms. Eisapour is ultimately asking this Court to reweigh and remake the Officer’s \n\ndecision, not something that this Court can do on judicial review (Vavilov at para 125). One must \n\nlook at an administrative decision-maker’s reasons holistically and consider them in their entirety \n\n(Vavilov at para 97). Here, while concise, the reasons are responsive to the central aspects of \n\nMs. Eisapour’s Application, along with the relevant requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR. For \n\nthese reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1000 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 8 \n\nJUDGMENT in IMM-6847-24 \n\nTHIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that: \n\n1.

Overview \n\n[1] The Applicant, George Merijohn, applied for permanent residence under the Federal \n\nSkilled Worker Class (“Skilled Worker Application”). An officer at Immigration, Refugees and \n\nCitizenship Canada (“the Officer”) refused Mr. Merijohn’s Skilled Worker Application. He \n\nchallenges this refusal on judicial review. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1003 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\n[2] Mr. Merijohn argues that the Officer’s decision is unreasonable because: i) it is internally \n\nincoherent; ii) it requires all duties listed in the National Occupational Classification (“NOC”) to \n\nbe part of the job; and iii) it considers his job duties against the wrong NOC subgroup. \n\n[3] I do not agree that the Officer’s decision is internally incoherent or requires that all duties \n\nbe performed as set out in the NOC. Though I agree with the Applicant that the Officer \n\nreferenced the wrong NOC subgroup, the Officer’s core concern applied to both NOC subgroups \n\nwhich both involved senior manager level positions. The Officer found that Mr. Merijohn had no \n\nemployees and that this was inconsistent with being a senior manager. Mr. Merijohn has not \n\nraised any sufficiently serious shortcoming with key basis on which the Officer refused the \n\napplication. Accordingly, I dismiss the judicial review. \n\nII. Procedural History \n\n[4] Mr. Merijohn, a dentist trained in the United States, set up a company in B.C. to provide \n\nhealth consulting services. Mr. Merijohn was President/CEO for the company and in February \n\n2021 obtained a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (“LMIA”) for this position under \n\nthe NOC 0013 – Senior managers – financial, communications and other business services. In \n\nJune 2021, he was issued a work permit to work as the President/CEO of his company. \n\n[5] Approximately a year later, Mr. Merijohn entered the express entry pool of candidates for \n\nthe Federal Skilled Worker program. As part of his request to be invited to apply, Mr. Merijohn \n\nincluded 200 additional points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (“CRS”) for having an \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1003 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\n“arranged employment”. In July 2022, based on his points, Mr. Merijohn received an invitation \n\nto apply for permanent residence. \n\n[6] In reviewing his application for permanent residence, the Officer had concerns about the \n\nnature of the “arranged employment” for which Mr. Merijohn received 200 additional points in \n\nthe express entry pool. On December 23, 2023, the Officer sent him a procedural fairness letter \n\nthat expressed concern with the limited information provided on the nature of the work he was \n\ndoing and intended to do – the basis for receiving 200 points for “arranged employment”. The \n\nOfficer noted: \n\nYou claimed 200 CRS points for this job offer, however you have \nnot submitted sufficient documentary evidence to support this level \nof declared NOC. A review of your immigration history indicates \nyou are working on a LMIA based work permit, but you have \nprovided very limited information about your current employment \nand job offer. \n\n[7] The Officer then requested a series of documents regarding Mr. Merijohn’s “arranged \n\nemployment” including financial documents, an organizational chart, and forms for employees in \n\n2021 and 2022. Mr. Merijohn responded to the procedural fairness letter and provided further \n\ndocumentation. \n\n[8] On January 3, 2024, the Officer refused Mr. Merijohn’s Skilled Worker Application \n\nunder paragraph 11.2(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 \n\n[IRPA]. The Officer was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to indicate that Mr. \n\nMerijohn “possesses a qualifying offer of arranged employment under Major Group 00 of the \n\nNOC matrix”. The Officer found that Mr. Merijohn was invited to apply for permanent residence \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1003 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nbased on having “a qualifying offer of arranged employment under Major Group 00 of the NOC \n\nmatrix” and that, without these additional points for arranged employment in this category (200 \n\npoints), he would not have been invited to apply at that time based on his score. \n\n[9] Following the refusal decision, Mr. Merijohn submitted additional documentation that \n\nwas reviewed by the Officer on January 10, 2024. The Officer noted that these documents \n\n“align[ed] consistently with the financial documentation previously submitted…” and therefore \n\ndid not change their decision. \n\nIII. Issue and Standard of Review \n\n[10] Mr. Merijohn is not challenging the procedure followed by the Officer. Mr. Merijohn \n\ncentres his arguments on the substance of the decision. The parties agree, as do I, that I ought to \n\nreview the merits of the Officer’s decision on a reasonableness standard. \n\n[11] The Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v \n\nVavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] described a reasonable decision as “one that is based on an \n\ninternally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and \n\nlaw that constrain the decision maker” (Vavilov at para 85). Administrative decision-makers \n\nmust ensure that their exercise of public power is “justified, intelligible and transparent, not in \n\nthe abstract, but to the individuals subject to it” (Vavilov at para 95). \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1003 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\nIV. Analysis \n\n[12] The Officer refused the application because they found that at the time of the invitation, \n\nMr. Merijohn “[did] not have the qualifications on the basis of which they were ranked under an \n\ninstruction given under paragraph 10.3(1)(h) and [was] consequently issued the invitation” \n\n(IRPA, paragraph 11.2(1)(b)). Reading the Officer’s decision as a whole, their key concern is that \n\nMr. Merijohn’s arranged work did not involve the management of other employees and therefore \n\nwas not appropriately classified as part of the “Major Group 00 of the NOC matrix” as a “senior \n\nmanager” who had to supervise the work of “middle managers”. \n\n[13] Mr. Merijohn makes several arguments challenging the decision. First, he argues that the \n\ndecision is internally incoherent. At the outset of the decision the Officer states that Mr. \n\nMerijohn met the “minimal entry criteria” of the Federal Skilled Worker Class as set out in \n\nsection 75 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR]. Later \n\nin the decision the Officer explains their concerns with Mr. Merijohn’s “arranged employment” \n\nin reference to the criteria in paragraphs 75(b) and (c) of IRPR, considering the lead statement \n\nfor the NOC and the duties listed for the NOC. \n\n[14] While the Officer’s decision could have been worded more clearly, read holistically, \n\nthere is no doubt that the Officer had concerns about Mr. Merijohn’s “arranged employment” \n\nand whether it was consistent with a senior manager NOC. This is clear throughout the decision. \n\nReasons are not reviewed against a “standard of perfection” (Vavilov at para 91). \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1003 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\n[15] Mr. Merijohn also argues that the Officer was unreasonable in requiring that he meet all \n\nof the job duties listed in the NOC. Mr. Merijohn asserts that by commenting that three of the six \n\njob duties were not being performed, the Officer was requiring that he do all the job duties listed \n\nin the NOC. Yet, the NOC itself states that “some or all” of the duties may be performed. \n\n[16] In my view, the Officer was pointing to these particular three duties because they \n\nillustrate their central concern – that Mr. Merijohn does not manage other employees and this \n\nwas inconsistent with the nature of a senior manager NOC. This requirement to manage others is \n\nset out by the lead statement, whether considering the NOC under which Mr. Merijohn applied \n\n(NOC 0013 – senior manager in finance) or the NOC the Officer considered (NOC 00013 – \n\nsenior manager in health). \n\n[17] This leads to the last argument advanced by Mr. Merijohn – the decision should be set \n\naside because the Officer considered Mr. Merijohn’s employment against a NOC under which he \n\ndid not apply or receive his LMIA. I agree with Mr. Merijohn that the Officer did not \n\nacknowledge nor explain why they were referencing a different NOC. \n\n[18] However, in the particular circumstances of this case, I cannot see how remedying this \n\nerror would have made a difference to the Officer’s decision. I say this being mindful that it is \n\nnot the Court’s role to fill in the gaps of the Officer’s decision and that we must, on \n\nreasonableness review, engage with the reasons that the decision-maker actually provided \n\n(Vavilov at paras 84-87). \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1003 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\n[19] The Officer’s concern about the evidence filed in relation to the “arranged employment” \n\nis clear. As stated by the Officer: \n\nThe PA’s representative highlights the last sentences of [the] lead \nstatement of the declared NOC emphasizing that …[he] may own \nand operate their own business. While the applicant can own and \noperate their business as self-employed person, it is important to \nacknowledge the need for directing and coordinating employees’ \nwork to align with CEO/President role. Based on the evidence, … \n[the Applicant] is [a] self-employed person managing a small \nconsulting business that provides services for dental health \nprofessionals. However, the evidence does not demonstrate \nsubstantial human resources and organizational structure essential \nfor fulfilling senior management duties under NOC 00013. \n\n[20] This concern is not unique to the specific NOC the Officer considered. In fact, the Officer \n\nindicated throughout the decision that their concern was that the Applicant received an invitation \n\nbased on having an “arranged employment” “under the Major Group 00 of the NOC matrix”. In \n\nother words, a senior management position, not particular to a specific NOC subgroup. As I have \n\nalready indicated, the lead statements for both NOCs (the one declared by the Applicant and the \n\nOfficer’s reference) state that senior manager roles involve organizing and planning “through \n\nmiddle managers”. \n\n[21] The Officer provided Mr. Merijohn an opportunity to respond to their concerns about his \n\n“arranged employment” and then thoroughly reviewed his responding documents and provided a \n\nclear rationale for their refusal.

Overview \n\n[1] The Applicant, Mr. Leonard Ugochuk Onumonu, is a citizen of Nigeria, who arrived in \n\nCanada in 2017 and made a claim for refugee protection in Canada in which he indicated having \n\nbeen a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra [IPOB]. He was referred for an admissibility \n\nhearing before the Immigration Division [ID] pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the Immigration and \n\nRefugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. The issue to be assessed was whether he was \n\ninadmissible on security grounds under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA, for being a member of an \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n2 \n \n\norganization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in \n\nacts referred to in paragraph (b), namely, an organization engaging in or instigating the subversion \n\nby force of any government. His refugee claim has been suspended until a determination is made \n\non his admissibility. \n\n[2] Further to the admissibility hearing, the ID, through a detailed decision dated April 23, \n\n2024, found the Applicant to be a person described in section 34 of the IRPA, and issued a \n\nDeportation Order against him [Decision]. He now seeks judicial review of the Decision by way \n\nof an order for a writ of certiorari quashing the Decision and an order for a writ of mandamus \n\ncompelling a newly reconstituted tribunal to hold the admissibility hearing and costs. \n\n[3] The Applicant does not contest the ID’s findings that the IPOB is an organization under \n\nparagraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA and he voluntarily admits that he was a member of the IPOB. \n\nHowever, he disagrees that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the IPOB has engaged in \n\nor instigated the subversion by force of the government of Nigeria. He further submits that the ID \n\nmade numerous errors in fact and in law, misconstrued evidence, misconstrued arguments and \n\nbreached natural justice, and that the Decision rendered raises issues of procedural fairness and \n\nreasonableness. \n\n[4] Amongst the information filed by the Applicant in support of his application for leave and \n\njudicial review are two ID decisions in which the ID found that there was not enough evidence to \n\nreasonably believe that the IPOB had engaged in or instigated the subversion by force of the \n\ngovernment of Nigeria. In the Applicant’s view, the Decision under review is unreasonable as the \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nID failed to consider these two prior decisions which ought to be applied based on the principle of \n\njudicial comity. \n\n[5] In summary, Mr. Onumonu argues that because the IPOB is fighting for “human rights and \n\nthe self-determination of the Igbo people”, the IPOB’s actions should not be considered to be \n\nengaging in or instigating the subversion by force of the Nigerian government. \n\n[6] The parties agree that there are no credibility issues in this case. Moreover, there are no \n\nallegations that Mr. Omunomu himself engaged in or instigated the subversion by force of the \n\ngovernment of Nigeria. \n\n[7] That said, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [Minister] submits that the ID \n\nconducted a thorough assessment of the country condition evidence and reasonably found that the \n\nApplicant is inadmissible for membership in an organization which has engaged in subversion by \n\nforce of the Nigerian government. The ID outlined in details the organization’s violent rhetoric \n\nand attacks aimed at achieving independence for Biafra. The ID properly noted that an \n\norganization’s motivation for its acts of subversion is not relevant to an assessment of whether or \n\nnot those acts constituted acts of subversion. Thus, according to the Minister, the Applicant has \n\nfailed to identify any reviewable error and therefore the Decision ought not to be disturbed as it \n\nwas reasonable. \n\n[8] At the hearing, the Applicant submitted two questions to be certified. The Respondent \n\nopposed the certification of these questions. Given the late filing, and under reserve, the Court \n\nallowed the parties to provide written submissions regarding these questions. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n[9] For the reasons that follow, Mr. Onumonu’s application for judicial review will be \n\ndismissed. Given the legislative dispositions and the record before this Court, the Court has not \n\nbeen convinced that the Decision is unreasonable. Moreover, the Court will not certify any \n\nquestions. \n\nII. Analysis \n\nA. Preliminary Issue \n\n[10] The Minister asserts that in his Memorandum, the Applicant raises a new issue that was \n\nnot before the ID, namely that paragraph 34(1)(b) of the IRPA, due to its broad application, goes \n\n“against the very objective of the Act, to support international law and Canadian international \n\ninterest”. \n\n[11] The Minister submits that it is generally inappropriate for this Court to consider, on judicial \n\nreview, an issue that could have been but was not raised before the administrative decision maker \n\ndespite having had the opportunity to do so (Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v \n\nAlberta Teachers' Association, 2011 SCC 61 at para 23 [Alberta Teachers]). \n\n[12] The Court agrees with the Minister that the issue, as now raised by the Applicant, was not \n\nraised before the ID, although it could have been, and should therefore not be considered by the \n\nCourt. There are multiple justifications to the general rule that an issue must first be raised to the \n\ndecision maker. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada: “This is particularly true where the \n\nissue raised for the first time on judicial review relates to the tribunal’s specialized functions or \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nexpertise.” (Alberta Teachers at paras 24-25; see also Manneh v Unifor, 2022 FCA 107 at para 9; \n\nBrown v Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FC 458 at para 19) \n\nB. Standard of Review \n\n[13] The parties agree that in the context of a judicial review of an ID decision, the applicable \n\nstandard of review is reasonableness, as per the teachings of the Supreme Court of Canada in its \n\nlandmark decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC \n\n65 [Vavilov] (see also (Mason v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at \n\npara 7 [Mason]). \n\n[14] In Chukwudi v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 423 \n\n[Chukwudi], a case referred to by both parties involving IPOB, Justice Gascon provides a good \n\nsummary of the role of a reviewing Court when the standard of review is reasonableness: \n\n[12] Reasonableness is the presumptive standard that reviewing \ncourts must apply when conducting judicial review of the merits of \nan administrative decision (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) \nv Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]. Reasonableness focuses on the \ndecision made by the administrative decision maker, which \nencompasses both the reasoning process and the outcome \n(Vavilov at paras 83, 87). Where the applicable standard of review \nis reasonableness, the role of a reviewing court is to examine the \nreasons given by the administrative decision maker and to determine \nwhether the decision is based on “an internally coherent and rational \nchain of analysis” and is “justified in relation to the facts and law \nthat constrain the decision maker” (Vavilov at para 85). The \nreviewing court must therefore consider whether the “decision bears \nthe hallmarks of reasonableness — justification, transparency and \nintelligibility” (Vavilov at para 99). \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n[13] Such a review must include a rigorous evaluation of \nadministrative decisions. However, as part of its analysis of the \nreasonableness of a decision, the reviewing court must begin its \ninquiry by examining the reasons provided with “respectful \nattention,” and seeking to understand the reasoning process \nfollowed by the decision maker to arrive at its conclusion (Vavilov at \npara 84). The reviewing court must adopt an attitude of restraint and \nintervene “only where it is truly necessary to do so in order to \nsafeguard the legality, rationality and fairness of the administrative \nprocess” (Vavilov at para 13). \n\n[14] The onus is on the party challenging the administrative decision \nto prove that it is unreasonable. Flaws must be more than superficial \nfor a reviewing court to overturn an administrative decision. The \ncourt must be satisfied that there are “sufficiently serious \nshortcomings” (Vavilov at para 100). When the reasons contain a \nfundamental gap or an unreasonable chain of analysis, a reviewing \ncourt may have grounds to intervene. \n\nC. Relevant Provisions \n\n[15] Section 33 of the IRPA outlines the rules of interpretation for inadmissibility findings, \n\nincluding the applicable standard of proof that there be “reasonable grounds to believe”: \n\nDIVISION 4Inadmissibility SECTION 4Interdiction de \nterritoire \n\nRules of interpretation Interprétation \n\n33 The facts that constitute 33 Les faits — actes ou \ninadmissibility under sections omissions — mentionnés \n34 to 37 include facts arising aux articles 34 à 37 sont, sauf \nfrom omissions and, unless disposition contraire, \notherwise provided, include appréciés sur la base de motifs \nfacts for which there are raisonnables de croire qu’ils \nreasonable grounds to believe sont survenus, surviennent ou \nthat they have occurred, are peuvent survenir. \noccurring or may occur. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n[16] The ground for inadmissibility stated in the section 44 reports is found in paragraphs \n\n34(1)(b) and (f) of the IRPA: \n\nDIVISION 4 SECTION 4 \nEntering and Remaining in Canada Interdictions de territoire \n\nSecurity Sécurité \n\n34 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign 34 (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire \nnational is inadmissible on security pour raison de sécurité les faits suivants : \ngrounds for \n\n \n\n(b) engaging in or instigating the b) être l’instigateur ou l’auteur d’actes \nsubversion by force of any government; visant au renversement d’un \n\ngouvernement par la force; \n\n(f) being a member of an organization that f) être membre d’une organisation dont il \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe y a des motifs raisonnables de croire \nengages, has engaged or will engage in qu’elle est, a été ou sera l’auteur d’un acte \nacts referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (b.1) visé aux alinéas a), b), b.1) ou c). \nor (c). \n\nD. Applicable Standard of Proof \n\n[17] When rendering the Decision, the ID noted that the standard of proof required is \n\n“reasonable grounds to believe”. This is compliant with section 33 of the IRPA. The Supreme \n\nCourt of Canada in Mugesera v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40 \n\nat para 114 states that this standard “requires something more than a mere suspicion, but less than \n\nthe standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities”. \n\n[18] Citing Oremade v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1077 at \n\npara 27, the ID also noted in its Decision that the jurisprudence has confirmed that “subversion by \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nforce” does not require proof that the organization has in fact committed violent acts against the \n\ngovernment, but that it must consider any act or process of overthrowing the government. The \n\nCourt agrees. As summarized by Justice Gascon in Chukwudi: \n\n[18] … Subversion by force has been defined by the courts in a \nnumber of cases. According to the Federal Court of \nAppeal, “subversion” means “the act or process of overthrowing the \ngovernment” (Najafi v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness), 2014 FCA 262 [Najafi] at para 65). In Oremade v \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC \n1077 [Oremade], this Court held that the term “by force” is not \nstrictly equivalent to “by violence;” rather, it “includes coercion or \ncompulsion by violent means, coercion or compulsion by threats to \nuse violent means, and (…) reasonably perceived potential for the \nuse of coercion by violent means” (Oremade at para 27). In Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration) v USA, 2014 FC 416 [USA], this \nCourt further determined that subversion by force means “[any] act \nthat is intended to contribute to the process of overthrowing a \ngovernment, or most commonly as the use or encouragement of \nforce, violence or criminal means with the goal of overthrowing a \ngovernment, either in part of its territory or in the entire \ncountry” [emphasis in original] (USA at para 36). Subversion by \nforce thus has an extensive meaning. \n\nE. The Decision is Reasonable \n\n[19] At the hearing, the Applicant raised several arguments that were not included in his \n\nMemorandum of Fact and Law. The Minister objected to these arguments, stressing that the \n\nApplicant had not filed a Further Memorandum and was therefore surprised by many arguments \n\nraised. The Court agrees with the Minister that several arguments were raised for the first time \n\nduring the hearing and has thus only discussed arguments which were included in the Applicant’s \n\nMemorandum, same for those that the Minister made responding representations. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n[20] As previously stated, the Applicant admits having been a member of the IPOB and does \n\nnot contest that the IPOB is an organization as construed by paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA. The \n\nonly question before this Court is whether it was reasonable for the ID to conclude that there were \n\nreasonable grounds to believe that the IPOB intended to subvert the government of Nigeria by \n\nforce. \n\n[21] To support his position that the Decision is unreasonable, the Applicant filed two ID \n\ndecisions that he claims found that the IPOB did not engage in or instigate the subversion by force \n\nof the Nigerian government. However, as noted during the hearing, those two decisions did not \n\nmake that determination. Instead, the ID panel’s conclusion was that there was insufficient \n\nevidence to conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the IPOB intended to \n\nsubvert the government of Nigeria by force. There is no evidence in the record that the ID in this \n\ncase had access to the exact same evidence that was filed by the parties in those two decisions such \n\nthat a similar conclusion was inevitable, as suggested by the Applicant. \n\n[22] Further, at the hearing the Applicant stressed that section 162 of the IRPA and the principle \n\nof judicial comity meant that the ID was bound to make similar findings of fact that those made in \n\nthe two other ID decisions, unless the ID explicitly explained why it was not making those similar \n\nfindings. The Court disagrees. \n\n[23] First, the principle of judicial comity applies to questions of law, not findings of fact (R v \n\nSullivan, 2022 SCC 19 at para 44; Popovici v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC \n\n960 at para 25). Second, as mentioned above, it is not for this Court to reassess the evidence that \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nwas before the ID in this case (Vavilov at para 125), nor the evidence before two other ID panels \n\n(which, in any case, is not before the Court), in an attempt to determine which panel was right. \n\nThird, as Justice Gascon notes at paragraph 28 of Chukwudi, another panel’s conclusion cannot be \n\nblindly replicated: “subversion must be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the available \n\nevidence”. This Court is not bound by other ID decisions as the facts and evidence in each case \n\nbefore the ID may not be the same. \n\n[24] Moreover, the ID was not bound to follow the legal findings of previous ID decisions \n\n(International Longshore and Warehouse Union - Canada v British Columbia Maritime \n\nEmployers Association, 2024 FCA 142 at para 82 citing Vavilov at paras 131-132;  Canada \n\n(Attorney General) v National Police Federation, 2022 FCA 80 at para 48). Thus, while it may \n\nhave been preferable for the ID to address the two decisions submitted by the Applicant and explain \n\nwhy it did not find them compelling in this case, it was not unreasonable for the ID to reach a \n\ndifferent conclusion as they were not binding authority. In fact, as noted by the ID, at paragraph \n\n13 of its Decision, the Applicant himself cited Chukwudi at paragraph 28 and argued that “the \n\nFederal Court found that the notion ‘of subversion must be determined on a case-by-case basis in \n\nlight of the available evidence [and that] (c)ontradictory or mixed evidence about the IPOB can \n\naccount for the presence of more than one reasonable outcomes.’” \n\n[25] As such, this Court must instead determine if, in this case, the ID’s conclusion that there \n\nwas “reasonable grounds to believe” that the IPOB intended to subvert the government of Nigeria \n\nby force was reasonable based on the evidence before it and if the Decision, as a whole, “bears the \n\nhallmarks of reasonableness—justification, transparency and intelligibility” (Vavilov at para 99; \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nLapaix v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2025 FC 111 at para 43 [Lapaix]; Zahw v Canada \n\n(Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 934 at para 33 [Zahw]). \n\n[26] In this case, the ID made numerous findings in support of its determination that the IPOB \n\nengaged in acts which fall under paragraph 34(1)(b) of the IRPA. These findings are well \n\nsummarized by the Minister at paragraph 12 of their Further Memorandum of Argument, and are \n\nnot contested by the Applicant: \n\n(i) the pursuit of secession can be considered a form of government \noverthrow, as the intention of the IPOB is to have the Nigerian \ngovernment withdraw from Biafran territory; \n\n(ii) the use of force by an oppressed people seeking self-\ndetermination is not excluded from consideration under section \n34(1)(b). Consequently, the ID need not consider evidence of the \nNigerian government’s acts of persecution, as such evidence is \nirrelevant; \n\n(iii) subversion by force can include violent acts, as well as threats \nof violence intended to subvert the government; \n\n(iv) the IPOB has engaged in two principal forms of subversion – its \ndiscourse and its violent acts; \n\n(v) regarding the IPOB’s discourse, the organization has:  \n\n- issued threats of violence and incitement to violence; \n\n- threatened that if the government fails to “give us Biafra, \nSomalia will look like a paradise, compared to what \nhappened there”; \n\n- stated it needs “guns and bullets” from America, and if it \ndoes not “get Biafra” everyone must die; \n\n- issued statements calling for the destruction of the state of \nNigeria, declaring “Nigeria must die”, “Nigeria will fall”, \nand “Biafra will come or every will perish”; \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n- issued statements indicating that the IPOB was willing to \nengage in a war with the Nigerian state, including killing \ngovernors, police, or army members if any Biafrans are \nkilled;  \n\n(vi) regarding the IPOB’s use of violence, the organization has \nengaged in a series of violent attacks and clashes with government \nforces, some of which have resulted in civilian deaths:  \n\n- attacks attributed to IPOB have increased since its armed \nwing, the Eastern Security Network [ESN], was formed in \nDecember 2020; \n\n- serious fighting occurred between Nigerian forces and the \nESN in January 2021, leading to a significant number of \ndisplaced persons; \n\n- in April 2021, it was reported that ESN members stormed \na state police command, looted the armoury and torched the \nbuilding, and then freed over 1,800 prisoners from a \ncorrectional centre; \n\n- in Southeast Nigeria, ESN was involved in the killing of \ndozens of security operatives and attacks on at least ten \nbuildings, including prisons and police stations; \n\n- attacks on police stations and checkpoints have increased \nsince March 2022, resulting in fatalities. \n\n[27] Based on the evidence of violent rhetoric and acts before the ID, the Court is satisfied it \n\nwas not unreasonable for the ID to conclude that the IPOB had engaged in subversion by force. \n\n[28] Further, as submitted by the Minister, the Applicant argues that because the IPOB is \n\nfighting for “human rights and the self-determination of the Igbo people”, its actions cannot be \n\nconstrued as subversion by force of the Nigerian government. The Applicant cites no jurisprudence \n\nto support this argument. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n[29] Contrary to the Applicant’s submission, and as argued by the Minister, the Federal Court \n\nof Appeal in Najafi v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2014 FCA 262 \n\n[Najafi] and this Court in Chukwudi, held that an organization’s motivation to oust a government \n\nby force is not relevant to the analysis under paragraph 34(1)(b) of the IRPA. What matters is the \n\norganization’s intent to subvert a government by force (Chukwudi at para 20 citing Zahw at para \n\n54). The Court further held that even the right to self-determination claimed by an oppressed \n\npeople is not a sufficient consideration to exclude the use of force from the scope of paragraph \n\n34(1)(b) (Chukwudi at para 20 citing Najafi at paras 46, 109). \n\n[30] While the Applicant asserts paragraph 34(1)(b) of the IRPA should not capture those who \n\nfight for human rights and self-determination, the Minister submits that Parliament intended \n\n“subversion by force of any government” to have a broad application at the inadmissibility stage. \n\nThis broad application does not lead to unreasonable results as the IRPA provides for “ministerial \n\nexemption to protect those whose admission to Canada would not be contrary to the national \n\ninterest”. Thus, the effects of this provision can be mitigated by an exemption from the Minister \n\n(citing Najafi at paras 78, 80-81, 89-91). \n\n[31] At the hearing, the Applicant responded that a ministerial exemption was a highly \n\ndiscretionary decision from the Minister which was very difficult to obtain. As such, the Applicant \n\nargued that this argument was illusory. In reply, the Minister stressed that the case law, including \n\nNajafi, is clear that the existence of ministerial relief is sufficient to find that paragraph 34(1)(b) \n\nshould be broad in its scope. The Court agrees and notes this Court in Lapaix recently summarized \n\nthe Federal Court of Appeal’s findings on this issue: \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n[46] In Najafi, the FCA concluded that “Parliament intended for the \nprovision to be applied broadly” (at para 80), and that \nthe “legality” or “legitimacy” of the alleged acts was not relevant to \nthe application of paragraph 34(1)(b) (at para 90). The FCA \nexplained that the inadmissibility set out in section 34 had to be \nbroad because Parliament provided authority to the Minister to \nexempt foreign nationals from inadmissibility if it is not contrary to \nnational interest to do so. Thus, the legitimacy of a government’s \noverthrow, in the context of a people ruled by a dictator for example, \ncould be a relevant factor for the Minister to consider under section \n42.1 of the IRPA, but it is not a relevant factor in the context of an \ninadmissibility analysis under section 34 (at para 90; see \nalso Oremade at para 18). In an application under section 42.1, the \nMinster must review the facts of the case and balance them with \nother Canadian fundamental values, such as national interest and \nnational security (at para 106). Insomuch as the “member” within \nthe meaning of paragraph 34(1)(f) did not participate actively or in \na sufficiently significant way in the activities the organization is \naccused of, or for other reasons, the Minister could consider a waiver \nof inadmissibility since it would not be contrary to national interest \nto do so. In other words, the lawful or unlawful nature of the \nsubversive acts is irrelevant at the inadmissibility stage. The type \nof “government” targeted by the acts is also irrelevant: the words of \nthe Act “do not on their face, imply a qualification of any kind with \nrespect to the government in question” (Najafi at para 70). It is \nsufficient for the acts to have been committed with the intent to \ncontribute to the process of overthrowing a government (USA at \npara 36). \n\n[32] Lastly, the Minister notes that the Applicant made a passing reference to the Charter but \n\nincludes no details of any Charter argument. The Court highlights the following passage from the \n\nFederal Court of Appeal in Covarrubias v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 \n\nFCA 365: \n\n[59] It is well established that Charter analyses should not, and must \nnot, be made in a factual vacuum: MacKay v. Manitoba, 1989 \nCanLII 26 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at page 361. That is, the \nabsence of a proper evidentiary basis to support alleged \nCharter violations is a fatal flaw to any application to declare a law \nunconstitutional. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n15 \n \n\n[33] Thus, the Court is satisfied the Applicant’s unsupported Charter argument cannot succeed. \n\nIII. Conclusion \n\n[34] Based on the various findings of the ID in support of its determination that the IPOB had \n\nin fact engaged in acts which fall under paragraph 34(1)(b) of the IRPA, it was reasonable for the \n\nID to conclude that the IPOB’s violent rhetoric and actions were sufficient to establish reasonable \n\ngrounds to believe that it intended to subvert the government of Nigeria by force. \n\n[35] Moreover, I agree with the Minister that the Applicant has failed to point to specific errors \n\nor flaws in the Decision. The Applicant bore the burden of proving that the ID made a reviewable \n\nerror when rendering the Decision (Vavilov at para 100). He did not meet this burden. \n\n[36] In light of the reasons above, the application for judicial review will be dismissed. \n\nIV. Proposed Certified Questions \n\n[37] At the hearing, counsel for the Applicant presented two questions to certify. The Minister \n\nobjected, arguing that the Court’s Practice Guidelines required advance notice of a proposed \n\nquestion for certification at least five days before the hearing. \n\n[38] Both the issue of the timing of these submissions and whether the questions should be \n\ncertified were taken under advisement. Thus, under reserve of this Court’s decision regarding \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n16 \n \n\ntiming, counsel was provided with an opportunity to file written submissions on the proposed \n\nquestions to certify, which are as follows: \n\ni. Is the current legal interpretation and application of what constitutes “engaging in or \n\ninstigating the subversion by force of any government” and the application of section \n\n34(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) incongruous with the \n\nObjectives of the Act, International Law, and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in \n\nparticular because it is too broad? \n\nii. In light of the fact that s.162 of the IRPA states that each division of the Board, \n\nincluding the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refuge Board, has sole \n\nand exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all findings of law and fact – when \n\nthe Immigration Division makes a finding of fact and law pursuant to s. 34(1)(b) of \n\nIRPA, are tribunals considering the same question of fact and law bound to either \n\nfollow their findings of FACT and LAW, or explain why in the case before them the \n\nfindings of the Immigration Division are not to be applied. And is the failure to do so \n\nan error of fact and law, as well a breach of judicial comity? \n\n[39] First, regarding timing, this Court agrees with the Respondent that the Court’s \n\nConsolidated Practice Guidelines for Citizenship, Immigration, and Refugee Protection \n\nProceedings (last amended on October 31, 2023) [Guidelines] are clear and provide that a party \n\nintending to raise a certified question must notify the other party at least five days prior to the \n\nhearing: \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n36. Pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the IRPA, “an appeal to the \nFederal Court of Appeal may be made only if, in rendering \njudgment, the judge certifies that a serious question of general \nimportance is involved and states the question”. Parties are expected \nto make submissions regarding paragraph 74(d) in written \nsubmissions filed before the hearing on the merits and/or orally at \nthe hearing. Where a party intends to propose a certified question, \nopposing counsel shall be notified at least five (5) days prior to the \nhearing, with a view to reaching a consensus regarding the language \nof the proposed question. \n\n[emphasis added] \n\n[40] As Justice Gascon stated in Medina Rodriguez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n\n2024 FC 401: \n\n[44]… These Guidelines are there to be followed, and submitting a \ncertified question at the last minute is not helpful to the Court nor \nfair for the opposing party. Moreover, a certified question is \nsupposed to be a question of general importance. Arguably, these \nare not issues that should arise on the eve of judicial review or as an \nafterthought. In this case, counsel for Mr. Rodriguez has not \nprovided any reason to explain the late submission of no less than \nfive certified questions. Such a practice is strongly discouraged by \nthe Court, and may be the basis for a refusal to consider the merits \nof a proposed certified question as it prejudices the other party as \nwell as the Court and does not serve the interests of justice.” In fact, \nthere are many cases where this Court has refused to permit the \nApplicant to raise questions to certify presented in violation of the \nCourt’s Guidelines (see amongst others Gardijan v Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 421 at paras 52-55; \nAdeosun v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1089 at \nparas 75-77; Rohan v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness), 2024 FC 1351 at paras 41-44). \n\n[41] Further, in Varela v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FCA 145, \n\nthe Federal Court of Appeal stressed the overarching objective of subsection 74(d) of the IRPA in \n\nthe statutory scheme, which includes timely considerations: \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n[23] This provision fits within a larger scheme designed to ensure \nthat a claimant’s right to seek the intervention of the courts is not \ninvoked lightly, and that such intervention, when justified, is timely. \n\n[42] In the present matter, counsel for the Applicant has not provided any reasonable \n\nexplanation regarding this late filing. Moreover, the proposed questions did not arise from any of \n\nthe submissions made by the Respondent. The questions now proposed by counsel were squarely \n\nraised by the Applicant in their materials. As such, counsel for the Applicant could have served \n\nand filed their proposed certified questions at any point after leave was granted. Not only did \n\ncounsel fail to file a Further Memorandum in this file, but they also waited until the morning of \n\nthe hearing to raise these questions. Therefore, in the circumstances, the Court is not prepared to \n\npermit the Applicant to raise the proposed certified questions. \n\n[43] That said, despite the Applicant’s failure to comply with the Guidelines, this Court decided \n\nto consider the proposed questions and is of the view that none of the questions meet the criteria \n\nfor certification as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Lunyamila v Canada (Public Safety \n\nand Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FCA 22 at para 46. The Court fully agrees with the \n\nMinister’s written submissions on this topic. \n\n  \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1004 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nJUDGMENT in IMM-7789-24 \n\nTHIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that: \n\n1.

Overview \n\n[1] The Applicants are a family: a couple and their minor child. The Applicants, citizens of \n\nMexico, applied for refugee protection in Canada because of their fear of being threatened and \n\nattacked by members of a drug cartel. The Refugee Protection Division (“RPD”) refused their \n\nclaims, finding that they could safely relocate to another city in Mexico. The Applicants \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\nappealed and filed new evidence before the Refugee Appeal Division (“RAD”). The RAD \n\nrefused to admit the new evidence and dismissed the appeal, confirming the RPD’s \n\ndetermination that the Applicants had a viable Internal Flight Alternative (“IFA”) in Mexico. \n\n[2] The Applicants challenge the RAD’s decision on judicial review. The Applicants raise \n\nseveral arguments. The determinative issue is the RAD’s treatment of the new evidence, and in \n\nparticular, the RAD’s refusal to admit evidence from Mr. Zepeda’s mother describing a recent \n\nattack she experienced by the drug cartel at issue. It is unnecessary for me to address the \n\nApplicants’ other arguments because the RAD’s treatment of the mother’s evidence requires the \n\ndecision be quashed and redetermined. \n\nII. Background to the Refugee Claim \n\n[3] Mr. Zepeda alleges that he was first approached by the drug cartel in January 2020. He \n\nwas threatened with death unless he paid a monthly extortion fee. Mr. Zepeda agreed. By \n\nDecember 2021, Mr. Zepeda was struggling to make the payments. He received threatening \n\nnotes outside of his family home, threatening to murder him and his family. \n\n[4] In January 2022, two men came to the family home and warned Ms. Zepeda that they \n\nwould kill her son if they were not paid. The Applicants filed a police complaint. \n\n[5] Later that same month, three armed men attacked Mr. Zepeda and his brother-in-law on \n\ntheir way home. The men threatened harm to all of Mr. Zepeda’s family, including his parents. \n\nThe Applicants decided they had to leave Mexico following this incident. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\n[6] Before they left, Mr. Zepeda’s brother’s truck was shot at, seriously injuring his brother \n\nand killing his nephew. \n\n[7] The Applicants arrived in Canada at the end of February 2022 and made a refugee claim. \n\nThe RPD heard their claim on July 28, 2023. On August 16, 2023, the RPD dismissed the claim \n\non the basis that there was a viable IFA. \n\n[8] The Applicants appealed the RPD’s decision. With their appeal, the Applicants filed the \n\nfollowing new evidence that the RAD marked as exhibits: \n\na. Exhibit A: Letter from Mr. Zepeda’s mother, dated August 12, 2023, describing an \n\nattack that happened to her that evening; \n\nb. Exhibit B: Letter from the Applicants’ neighbour, dated August 30, 2023, \n\ndescribing visits of armed men since family left; \n\nc. Exhibit C: Letter from residential complex manager, dated September 1, 2023, \n\ndescribing that armed men in different vehicles inquired about the Applicants’ \n\nwhereabouts several times a week; \n\nd. Exhibit D: an article describing the shooting of Mr. Zepeda’s brother-in-law and \n\nnephew, dated February 14, 2022; and \n\ne. Exhibit E: Letter from Mr. Zepeda describing the nature of the new evidence, why \n\nit was not provided sooner, and how it was obtained. \n\n[9] The RAD dismissed the appeal on November 20, 2023. The RAD did not admit the new \n\nevidence. The RAD accepted that the Applicants were generally credible in their claims. The \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nsole issue for the RAD, like the RPD, was IFA. On IFA, the RAD found that the Applicants had \n\nnot established with sufficient evidence on a balance of probabilities that the drug cartel would \n\nbe motivated to locate them in the IFA. \n\nIII. Analysis \n\n[10] The determinative issue on judicial review is the RAD’s decision to not admit new \n\nevidence on the appeal and in particular, the document it marked as Exhibit A – Mr. Zepeda’s \n\nmother’s letter. Mr. Zepeda’s mother describes being attacked by members of the drug cartel, \n\nwho threatened that they will find Mr. Zepeda no matter where he hides and that they are \n\nresponsible for the murder of Mr. Zepeda’s nephew. \n\n[11] The criteria for the admission of new evidence at the RAD is set out in subsection 110(4) \n\nof the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]: \n\n110(4). On appeal, the person 110(4) Dans le cadre de l’appel, \nwho is the subject of the appeal la personne en cause ne peut \nmay present only evidence that présenter que des éléments de \narose after the rejection of their preuve survenus depuis le rejet de \nclaim or that was not reasonably sa demande ou qui n’étaient alors \navailable, or that the person could pas normalement accessibles ou, \nnot reasonably have been s’ils l’étaient, qu’elle n’aurait pas \nexpected in the circumstances to normalement présentés, dans les \nhave presented, at the time of the circonstances, au moment du \nrejection. rejet. \n\n[12] The RAD correctly noted this statutory requirement and explained that in addition to \n\nthese constraints, it also had to consider whether the evidence is relevant, material, and credible \n\n(Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 96 [Singh FCA] at paras 38-49). \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\n[13] The Applicants argued that they could not have been reasonably expected to have \n\npresented the mother’s letter to the RPD because of the short time between when the attack \n\noccurred (Saturday, August 12, 2023 at 6pm) and when the RPD rendered its decision \n\n(Wednesday, August 16, 2023). \n\n[14] The RAD found that the Applicants had not met the requirements under subsection \n\n110(4) of IRPA because they had not sufficiently explained why they could not have presented \n\nthe mother’s letter to the RPD prior to it issuing its decision. \n\n[15] The Respondent on judicial review argued that the RAD had no discretion and had to \n\nreject the new evidence that pre-dated the RPD decision. It is certainly true that the RAD has no \n\ndiscretion but to apply the criteria set out in subsection 110(4) of IRPA in deciding whether to \n\nadmit new evidence (Singh FCA at para 63). However, under those criteria, two of the \n\ncircumstances where new evidence is allowed require the RAD to consider the claimants’ \n\ncircumstances and determine whether the evidence was either “reasonably available” or “could \n\nnot reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been presented” prior to the \n\nRPD’s decision. The Federal Court of Appeal in Singh explained that “the RAD always has the \n\nfreedom to apply the conditions of subsection 110(4) with more or less flexibility depending on \n\nthe circumstances of the case” (Singh FCA at para 64). \n\n[16] In my view, without more explanation, the RAD’s determination that new evidence \n\nshould be barred because it was produced about an event that took place four days – and only \n\ntwo intervening business days – prior to the RPD issuing its decision is unreasonable. There is no \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\nindication that the RAD meaningfully contemplated how a claimant would be able to provide \n\nthis evidence to the RPD within this short timeframe. \n\n[17] The attack happened on a Saturday evening. That same evening Mr. Zepeda was told \n\nabout the attack and Mr. Zepeda’s mother wrote a letter describing the attack in Spanish. The \n\nRAD’s position is that it was reasonable to expect, in two business days, that a claimant would \n\nbe able to provide the RPD with this evidence, which required at minimum for the evidence to \n\nbe: i) translated, ii) reviewed by the family’s lawyer; and iii) sent to the RPD. \n\n[18] Claimants do not necessarily have direct, immediate access to their lawyers. It is even \n\nmore difficult when one considers that an interpreter is often required. While the Applicants \n\ncertainly could have provided more detail in their submissions supporting the request to admit \n\nnew evidence, I can understand why they found it unnecessary to do so given the short \n\ntimeframe at issue. \n\n[19] In rejecting the Applicants’ explanation, the RAD’s reasons disclose no consideration of \n\nthe practical realities of submitting evidence. In these particular circumstances, the timeframe to \n\nfile the new evidence being so short, it was unreasonable for the RAD to find, without more \n\nexplanation, that it was reasonable to expect the claimants to have produced this evidence prior \n\nto the RPD’s rejection of their claim. \n\n[20] The consequence of the RAD’s finding is that a critical piece of evidence could not be \n\nconsidered in assessing the Applicant’s risk of return. It is not clear to me, in reading the RAD’s \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nreasons, that its refusal to admit the new evidence took into account the stakes of this decision \n\n(Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 133). \n\n[21] I want to also address the RAD’s credibility findings about the new evidence. At the \n\noutset of the RAD’s discussion about the credibility of the new evidence, it states “even if I were \n\nto find that Exhibits A-C meet one or more of the criteria under subsection 110(4) of IRPA, I \n\nfind under Singh/Raza, they are not credible.” \n\n[22] However, in the paragraphs that follow the RAD does not specifically address Mr. \n\nZepeda’s mother’s letter (Exhibit A). Moreover, what the RAD does say – that this evidence was \n\nproduced after the RPD decision in response to it – is inaccurate in respect of Mr. Zepeda’s \n\nmother’s letter, which was created before the RPD rejected the claim. And then at the conclusion \n\nof this credibility discussion, the RAD states “I therefore do not enter Exhibit B and C into \n\nevidence.” There is no mention of Exhibit A – Mr. Zepeda’s mother’s letter. Reading these \n\nparagraphs all together, the inclusion of Exhibit A in the first sentence of the credibility section \n\nappears to be in error. \n\n[23] The Respondent also argued that the RAD’s decision to not admit Mr. Zepeda’s mother’s \n\nletter was not determinative because it would not have affected the RAD’s ultimate conclusion \n\non IFA. \n\n[24] I do not agree. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 8 \n\n[25] The Respondent relied on the RAD’s reasoning in paragraph 49 of the decision, arguing \n\nthat the RAD found that even if it were to accept the new evidence, it still would have found that \n\nthe agent of persecution did not have the motivation to find the claimants in the IFA location. \n\n[26] First, I do not agree with this reading of paragraph 49 of the RAD decision. Second, even \n\nif I accept the Respondent’s reading, I find this statement by the RAD to be unintelligible given \n\nits prior justification for finding the drug cartel lacked motivation to seek the Applicants in the \n\nIFA location. \n\n[27] The RAD writes: \n\nHere, I reiterate again that I did not admit the evidence which the \nAppellants submitted the RAD as new evidence, and hence, do not \nfind that the Appellants have established with sufficient evidence \nthat the interest of the … [drug cartel] in them is demonstrable by \nthe recent attack on the Principal Appellant’s mother or that it has \nbeen paying visits to their home in Veracruz on a regular basis \nsince they left Mexico to find out when they would be returning. In \nrelation to this, I also find that even if this were the case, namely \nthat …[affiliates of the drug cartel] are visiting the Appellants’ \nhome in Veracruz to see if they returned, there is insufficient \nevidence to establish that the … [drug cartel] would therefore be \nmotivated on a balance of probabilities to spend time and resources \nto find and harm the Appellants in the … [IFA]. \n\n[28] First, as I noted at the hearing, where the RAD states “even if this were the case” – the \n\nRAD identifies the “this” in that phrase by saying “namely, that the… [drug cartel] are visiting \n\nthe Appellants’ home in Veracruz to see if they have returned”. This is the description of the \n\nevidence in Exhibits B and C and not Exhibit A – the mother’s letter. Therefore, it is unclear that \n\nthe RAD’s statement about irrelevance of the new evidence for its ultimate IFA assessment is \n\neven referring to Mr. Zepeda’s mother’s letter. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 9 \n\n[29] In any case, even if I am wrong on the interpretation of paragraph 49, I find the RAD \n\nfailed to explain why, if it had accepted the evidence of Mr. Zepeda’s mother, this would not \n\nhave affected its determination on the motivation of the drug cartel. The RAD only states this as \n\na conclusion and does not provide an explanation. An explanation was particularly necessary \n\ngiven the RAD’s previous findings on the drug cartel’s lack of motivation. \n\n[30] The RAD’s rationale for finding that the drug cartel lacked the motivation to seek out the \n\nApplicants in the IFA was based on the lack of contact with family members and that there was \n\nno evidence of a “personal vendetta”. The evidence about the attack of Mr. Zepeda’s mother is \n\nrelevant to those factual findings that formed a key part of the RAD’s assessment of the drug \n\ncartel’s motivation to seek the Applicants in the IFA location. \n\n[31] I find the RAD’s decision to not admit Mr. Zepeda’s mother’s letter was unreasonable. \n\nThis evidence was relevant to the RAD’s findings on the determinative issue – IFA. In these \n\ncircumstances, the RAD’s decision must be set aside and sent back for redetermination. Neither \n\nparty raised a question for certification and I agree none arises. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1005 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 10 \n\nJUDGMENT in IMM-16104-23 \n\nTHIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that: \n\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed; \n\n2. The RAD decision dated November 20, 2023 is set aside and sent back to be \n\nredetermined; and \n\n3.

IZZ \n\nApplicant \n\nand \n\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA \n\nRespondent \n\nORDER AND REASONS \n\n[1] On April 29, 2025, the Court issued a Notice of Status Review to the Applicant, \n\nMr. Bahaa M. Izz [Mr. Izz], based on the fact that more than 180 days had elapsed since the \n\nNotice of Application for Judicial Review [Notice of Application] was filed and despite \n\nMr. Izz’s motions, correspondence to the Court and the Court’s Directions, Mr. Izz has not taken \n\nthe required steps, in accordance with the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106 [the Rules] to \n\nadvance his Application for Judicial Review [the Application].  \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\n[2] In the Notice of Status Review, the Court explained that it had issued several Directions \n\nsince August 2024 directing the parties to provide their availability for and to attend Case \n\nManagement Conferences in order for Mr. Izz to clarify the allegations in the Notice of \n\nApplication and to establish a timetable for the next steps. The Court noted that Mr. Izz had \n\nrepeatedly refused to attend any Case Management Conference. The Court also noted that it had \n\nissued Orders and Directions clearly stating that Mr. Izz bears the onus of establishing his \n\nallegations as set out in his Notice of Application and that the next step was for him to file an \n\nApplication Record. \n\n[3] The Court further noted that Mr. Izz continues to frequently correspond with the Court, \n\nincluding to: raise evolving and confusing allegations; seek to dictate the process; demand that \n\nthe Respondent provide him with evidence he believes exists in order for him to establish the \n\nvery allegations which he bears the burden of establishing; and, advise the Court that he will \n\npursue other remedies, appeals and complaints. However, Mr. Izz has not taken the required \n\nsteps in accordance with the Rules to advance his Application. \n\n[4] Since the issuance of the Notice of Status Review, Mr. Izz has continued to correspond \n\nwith the Court and with the Office of the Chief Justice and has made several additional \n\nallegations about the Court and judges of this Court. Mr. Izz has issued ultimatums regarding the \n\ncomplaints he will pursue if the Court does not agree with him.  \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\nI. The Jurisprudence on Status Review \n\n[5] Upon receipt of a Notice of Status Review, the party in default, in this case Mr. Izz, is \n\nrequired to respond and answer two questions: (1) is there justification for the failure to move the \n\ncase forward, and (2) what measures does the party in default propose to take to move the case \n\nforward (St. Hilaire v Canada ( Attorney General) 2020 FCA 87 at para 4 [St. Hilaire], Lui v \n\nMatrikon Inc, 2010 FCA 329 at para 2, citing Baroud v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 1998 160 FTR 91 (TD), 1998 CanLII 8819 (FC) [Baroud]). \n\n[6] In Baroud, the Court explained at para 5: \n\nThe two questions are clearly inter-related in that if there is a good \nexcuse for the case not having progressed more quickly, the Court \nis not likely to be very exigent in requiring an action plan from the \nplaintiff. On the other hand, if no good reason is advanced to \njustify the delay, the plaintiff should be prepared to demonstrate \nthat he recognizes that he has a responsibility to the Court to move \nhis action along. Mere declarations of good intent and of the desire \nto proceed are clearly not enough. Likewise, the fact that the \ndefendant may have been lax and may not have fulfilled all his \nprocedural obligations is largely irrelevant: primary responsibility \nfor the carriage of a case normally rests with a plaintiff and at a \nstatus review the Court will look to him for explanations. \n\nII. Background \n\n[7] On July 15, 2024, Mr. Izz filed the Notice of Application, which states that it is filed \n\npursuant to subsection 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part \n\nI of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11 [the \n\nCharter]. Mr. Izz alleges that “threat reduction measures” were taken against him, which he \n\nreported to the police; that the release of information he requested through the Access to \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nInformation and Privacy process was obstructed; and, that alternative measures pursuant to the \n\nCriminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, were taken against him without his consent. Although no \n\ndetails of these allegations are provided, Mr. Izz claims that these alleged actions have deprived \n\nhim of his Charter rights, which he describes as including “enjoying his legitimate rights in \n\npursuaing [sic] and advancing lawful causes by his side (e.g. continuing his graduate education, \n\nhaving personal enrichment, capitalizing on his achievements, enjoying his well being and \n\nadvancing and improving his life quality on almost all levels and aspect [sic], immigrating to \n\nCanada, becoming a Canadian citizen and enjoy [sic] democratic rights)”. Mr. Izz does not \n\narticulate with any specificity how his rights were infringed or by whom; he states that the relief \n\nhe seeks will be “specified in separate judicial motions that can provide relevant details \n\nregarding their justifications and connections to the rights of the Applicant as per the Charter”.  \n\n[8] In response to correspondence from Mr. Izz, the Court has issued many Directions, \n\nseveral of which explain that the Court determines motions and applications in accordance with \n\nthe relevant statutory provisions and the Rules, and that generally, an applicant bears the burden \n\nof establishing their allegations.  \n\n[9] The Court’s Directions have also attempted to curtail Mr. Izz’s ongoing, persistent \n\ncorrespondence with the Court, the Registry, and the Office of the Chief Justice, yet it continues.  \n\n[10] On January 6, 2025, the Court dismissed Mr. Izz’s motion which sought to compel the \n\nRespondent to disclose, by way of an affidavit, a “Measures and Allegations report as per the \n\ndescription, terms and conditions of the Appendix A”. The Court’s Order notes that the proposed \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\nAppendix A was created by Mr. Izz and appears to be based on Mr. Izz’s speculation that certain \n\nmeasures have been taken against him. Mr. Izz had argued that the Respondent was required to \n\nfile an affidavit and exhibits, and that the Respondent had breached Rule 307 by not doing so. \n\nMr. Izz also sought to dictate the contents of the Respondent’s affidavit.  \n\n[11] The Court found that Rule 307 establishes the timeline for the filing of a respondent’s \n\naffidavits and exhibits but does not impose any obligation on a respondent to do so, and \n\naccordingly, the Respondent was not required to file an affidavit and exhibits in response to the \n\nApplication. \n\n[12] Mr. Izz subsequently filed a second motion seeking reconsideration of the Court’s \n\nJanuary 6, 2025, Order dismissing his motion to compel the Respondent to file an affidavit. \n\n[13] By Order dated February 7, 2025, the Court dismissed the second motion finding that a \n\nmotion for reconsideration is not the mechanism to dispute the Court’s decision, but rather an \n\nappeal could be pursued. \n\n[14] The Court stated, “Mr. Izz clearly wants this Court to reverse its Order; he wants the \n\nCourt to compel the Respondent to file an affidavit. Mr. Izz does not take “no” for an answer, as \n\nhe repeatedly demonstrates in his correspondence with the Court. The Court has clearly refused \n\nto compel the Respondent to file an affidavit and has provided its reasons. This motion is a \n\ndisguised attempt at an appeal; however, the Court does not sit in appeal of its own orders”. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\n[15] The Court added that in the event that Mr. Izz did not pursue an appeal, the next step \n\nwould be for Mr. Izz to file his Application Record.  \n\n[16] The Court also noted, among other things, that Mr. Izz’s applications (referring to this \n\nApplication and his now discontinued application in T-1088-24) and his motions lacked clarity \n\nand that many of his allegations and arguments were incomprehensible. The Court added that its \n\nattempts to convene Case Management Conferences to permit Mr. Izz to clarify his allegations \n\nand set out the next steps to move the Application forward had been ignored and/or rejected by \n\nMr. Izz. Instead, Mr. Izz sought to dictate a different procedure.  \n\n[17] The Court directed “that any further Motions or Applications by Mr. Izz that are in the \n\nproper format and are in accordance with the Rules and that raise justiciable issues will be \n\naccepted for filing only with leave of the Court; and that the Office of the Chief Justice will not \n\nrespond to any further correspondence by Mr. Izz, as Mr. Izz has been previously advised”. \n\nIII. Submissions on Status Review \n\n[18] In his submissions, Mr. Izz describes his relocation to Canada and his attempt to obtain a \n\nvisa to enter the United States, among other information, which does not appear to be related to \n\nhis Notice of Application and/or which is based on Mr. Izz’s misunderstanding about the \n\njurisdiction of this Court. He alleges that “authorities in Canada have continuously prevented the \n\nApplicant from obtaining key information related to his case”. Mr. Izz refers to other things that \n\nare not concepts known to this Court including that “martial judges” have issued “judicial \n\nauthorization against him…”, that foreign states have caused “national defence measures against \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nhim through state actors”, and that the Court should order “fact inspection and discovery”. \n\nMr. Izz submits that his Application should continue in accordance with his desired plan because \n\nthere are political aspects and foreign entities involved; false allegations have been made against \n\nhim (without indicating who has made the false allegations or what these allegations are); “there \n\nare indicators of judicial authorization against the Applicant (including by this Judge)”; “ATIP \n\ndisclosures does not always reflect facts that take place on grounds”; civil rights and judicial \n\nintegrity are at issue; and, that dismissing his Application will “harm the public and international \n\ntrust in the Canadian Courts”. Mr. Izz states that “when the Applicant receives disclosure from \n\nthe Respondent as part of facts inspection and discovery then he may only highlight the issues \n\nthat concerns him” [sic]. \n\n[19] Mr. Izz again alleges that the Respondent was required to produce documents to him and \n\nthat “the failure of the Respondent to meet its obligations… by facilitating cost effective facts \n\ninspection and discovery reduced the ability of the Applicant to litigate efficiently…”.  \n\n[20] Mr. Izz submits that his plan for advancing his Application requires the Respondent to: \n\n… facilitate facts inspection and discovery disclosure in a judicial \nproceeding (not through ATIP) by providing [him] with the \nfollowing: \n\nAll the authorized prejudices, interventions, decisions (judicial, \nquasi judicial or executive) that were made by Canadian or allied \ncountries about the Applicant. All the justification of authorized \ninterventions (including but not restricted to, claiming being an \ninformer or insider by allied entities). And the exact involved \nentities and everything that the Applicant was, or has been, \ninvestigated or suspected or accused with by Canadian authorities \nor their allies. All the details about the alternative to detention \nmeasures of the CBSA against him. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 8 \n\n[21] Mr. Izz proposes two options: first, that he file an informal motion to amend his Notice of \n\nApplication or to seek summary judgment to obtain the records he wants; and second, to wait \n\nuntil he can generate some income to permit him to obtain legal representation. He also seeks his \n\ncosts in this Status Review against the Respondent, arguing that the Respondent sought the \n\nreview and caused the delay. \n\n[22] The Respondent submits that the Application should be dismissed because Mr. Izz has \n\nnot provided a reasonable explanation for his delay or a reasonable plan to move his Application \n\nforward. The Respondent notes that Mr. Izz has failed to correct his deficient process despite \n\nextensive direction from this Court. \n\n[23] The Respondent notes that the Court has issued 16 Directions since the filing of the \n\nNotice of Application, Mr. Izz has sent over 33 letters to the Court (of which the Respondent is \n\naware) and that Mr. Izz has failed to attend Case Management Conferences.  \n\n[24] The Respondent notes that the information Mr. Izz has included in his submissions in \n\nresponse to the Notice of Status Review continues to make unfounded allegations without \n\nspecificity and refers to his immigration history (which is new information, the relevance of \n\nwhich is not apparent), yet fails to advance a plan to proceed with his Application. The \n\nRespondent further submits that Mr. Izz continues to make the same demands that the \n\nRespondent produce documents, which the Court has clearly stated is an issue for the Court to \n\ndetermine.  \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 9 \n\n[25] In Mr. Izz’s reply to the Respondent’s submissions, he seeks to blame the Respondent for \n\nmaking false allegations about him (of which there is absolutely no evidence to support) and for \n\ndelaying his Application, again arguing that the Respondent failed to file an affidavit in the \n\nrequired time period to produce documents that Mr. Izz assumes exist and are held by the \n\nRespondent. Mr. Izz also alleges that the Respondent has practiced “a vexatious attitude” and has \n\nobstructed justice, which has resulted in a miscarriage of justice and discrimination. Mr. Izz \n\nmakes other allegations that are not responsive to the issue on this Status Review.  \n\nIV. Mr. Izz’s Plan to Advance his Application is Rejected \n\n[26] Mr. Izz has not established a satisfactory justification for failing to move his Application \n\nforward since he filed his Notice of Application in July 2024. Mr. Izz’s proposed plan for the \n\nnext steps do not address the need to file an Application Record, which would be the only next \n\nstep. Mr. Izz’s submissions and proposals show, as in the past, that he does not accept the \n\nCourt’s Orders and Directions. Moreover, Mr. Izz’s Notice of Application, motions, \n\ncorrespondence, and current submissions add bits of unconnected information (much of which is \n\nconfusing and incomprehensible), mischaracterize and misunderstand legal concepts, and refer to \n\nmatters that are not known to this Court.  \n\n[27] Mr. Izz’s ultimatums indicating that he will pursue other recourse, including complaints \n\nabout the Court and its judges to other authorities, do not distract this Court from addressing the \n\ncurrent issue, which is whether Mr. Izz has provided a justification for his failure to advance his \n\nApplication and whether he has a realistic plan to do so. As noted in Baroud, declarations of \n\nintent and desire to proceed are not enough.  \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 10 \n\n[28] Mr. Izz has not satisfied the Court that he has a reasonable explanation for not taking the \n\nrequired procedural steps to pursue his Application. Mr. Izz blames the Respondent and the \n\nCourt for the delay and for his inability to file an Application Record. He fails to acknowledge \n\nthat the Court’s Orders and Directions, as described above, have attempted to seek clarity about \n\nhis allegations and have clearly advised him that the Respondent is not required to produce the \n\ndocuments he believes exist, even if relevant documents could be identified, in order for Mr. Izz \n\nto establish his allegations. He also fails to accept that, as he has been advised, he bears the onus \n\nof providing sufficient evidence to support his allegations in accordance with the law and the \n\nRules.  \n\n[29] Mr. Izz’s proposed plan again demands that the Court order the Respondent to “facilitate \n\nfacts inspection and discovery”, which the Court interprets as seeking the very same information \n\nthat the Court has addressed in its previous Orders and Directions, for which the Respondent is \n\nnot required to provide and for which the Court’s determination, in the context of Mr. Izz’s \n\nApplication, is required.  \n\n[30] In St. Hilaire, the Federal Court of Appeal conducted a status review and dismissed the \n\napplication for judicial review, finding that the applicant failed to meet the requirements \n\nestablished in the jurisprudence. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had sought to \n\nblame the respondent for delay and had been previously advised by the Court that he was not \n\nentitled to the information he sought. The Court of Appeal stated at paras 5-6: \n\n[5] As the applicant, Mr. St. Hilaire bears the burden of \nmoving this case forward: Cotirta v. Missinippi Airways, 2012 FC \n1262, 45 Admin. L.R. (5th) 255 at para. 15, 2012 FC 1262, aff’d \n2013 FCA 280.  While he did respond to the Notice of Status \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 11 \n\nReview, Mr. St. Hilaire has not provided a satisfactory explanation \nto justify his delay in pursuing this matter. His “explanation” for \nthe delay essentially consists of a series of allegations with respect \nto the alleged “evasive action” on the part of the respondent in \nfailing to produce witnesses for examination. \n\n[6] Nor has Mr. St. Hilaire provided a proposed timetable for \nthe completion of the steps necessary to advance the proceeding in \nan expeditious manner. Rather, he submits that “[i]n order to \nadvance the Proceedings and arrive at a timely, truthful disposition \nof this action, immediate direction by the Court to the Respondent \nfor all information currently being evaded or omitted for any \nreason”. With respect, this is an unsatisfactory response, \nparticularly in light of the fact that Mr. St. Hilaire has already been \ntold by this Court that he is not entitled to the information that he \nseeks. \n\n[31] This Court reaches the same conclusion, noting the similarities in the considerations; \n\nMr. Izz has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay and has failed to provide a \n\nreasonable plan or timetable for the completion of the next steps in his application.  \n\n[32] Mr. Izz’s proposal to amend his Notice of Application and seek summary judgment does \n\nnot make sense. \n\n[33] Mr. Izz’s proposal to earn income in order to retain legal representation is the only \n\nfeasible option but does not save this Application. Legal representation would assist Mr. Izz in \n\nidentifying whether he has any legal options to challenge identifiable decisions that have affected \n\nhim that could be the subject of an application for judicial review or other action.  \n\n[34] The Court acknowledges that Mr. Izz is a self-represented litigant and that navigating the \n\njudicial system is challenging. However, the Court and the Court’s Registry have attempted to \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 12 \n\nprovide direction to Mr. Izz regarding the proper procedure. As noted, Mr. Izz has refused to \n\nattend scheduled Case Management Conferences, which would have been an informal way to \n\nseek clarification of his Application. Further case management would be futile. Mr. Izz has also \n\neither rejected the Court’s Orders or does not fully understand them. Mr. Izz requires further \n\nguidance, ideally by way of legal representation, to assist him in pursing any valid claims he may \n\nhave, either related to the alleged breach of his Charter rights or with respect to particular \n\ndecisions that he can identify and has grounds to challenge.  \n\n[35] In the event that Mr. Izz obtains legal representation and seeks to pursue a Notice of \n\nApplication that sets out sufficient grounds for the relief he seeks, identifies justiciable issues \n\nand complies with the Rules, he may seek to pursue a new application or action in the future. The \n\ncurrent Application is dismissed. \n\n \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1007 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 13 \n\nORDER in T-1774-24 \n\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that: \n\n1.

An officer at \n\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (“the Officer”) refused the application. The \n\nOfficer found that Mr. Aina had not shown that he had sufficient and available financial \n\nresources to pay for the costs of study in Canada. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1009 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\n[2] I dealt with this case in writing, on consent of the parties, as part of the Court’s Study \n\nPermit Pilot project. \n\n[3] The requirement that an officer be satisfied that a person applying to study in Canada will \n\nnot overstay the period authorized for their stay is set out in subsections 11(1) and 20(1) of the \n\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 and in paragraph 216(1)(b) of the \n\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR]. \n\n[4] Section 220 of the IRPR provides that an Officer “shall not issue a study permit to a \n\nforeign national […] unless they have sufficient and available financial resources, without \n\nworking in Canada, to (a) pay the tuition fees for the course or program of study that they intend \n\nto pursue; (b) maintain themselves and any family members who are accompanying them during \n\ntheir proposed period of study; and (c) pay the costs of transporting themselves and the family \n\nmembers […] to and from Canada.” \n\n[5] Mr. Aina submitted with his study permit application that his father was the financial \n\nsponsor for his proposed education in Canada. Mr. Aina provided financial, employment and \n\nidentity documents for his father, as well as a letter from his father confirming the relationship \n\nand his support and his birth certificate where his father is listed. The Officer was not satisfied \n\nthat sufficient evidence had been provided to establish the relationship between the financial \n\nsponsor and Mr. Aina. In particular, the Officer noted that the name listed as Mr. Aina’s father \n\non the birth certificate was not the same as the name listed on the other documents provided with \n\nthe application relating to Mr. Aina’s father. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1009 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\n[6] I agree with Mr. Aina that the Officer breached procedural fairness in not giving him an \n\nopportunity to respond to their concerns about the nature of his relationship with the financial \n\nsponsor and in particular the concern about the spelling of the name on Mr. Aina’s birth \n\ncertificate. \n\n[7] While it is true that procedural fairness requirements in visa applications are minimal, \n\nofficers are still required to “give notice and seek additional information where they are \n\nconcerned about ‘the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of the information submitted by the \n\napplicant’” (Sungai v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2025 FC 825  at para 10, citing \n\nHassani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1283 at para 24). \n\n[8] The Officer ought to have given the Mr. Aina an opportunity to respond to their concern \n\nabout the nature of the relationship and in particular the concern about the spelling of his father’s \n\nname on his birth certificate. This is a sufficient basis to send the matter back to be redetermined. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1009 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nJUDGMENT in IMM-24165-24 \n\nTHIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that: \n\n1.

Within 20 minutes of his original submission, the Applicant re-submitted his profile with \n\nupdated information. That same day, Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada [IRCC] sent \n\nthe Applicant two letters. One letter informed him that he was not eligible for the Express Entry \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1011 (CanLII)\n\n\n\nPage: 2 \n \n\nprogram as he failed to meet the minimum requirements. The other letter stated that he had been \n\naccepted into the pool of candidates. \n\n[2] The Applicant purports to seek judicial review of IRCC’s refusal to invite him to apply for \n\npermanent residence in its Express Entry draw on or about October 10, 2023. The Applicant states \n\nthat this “decision” was received on March 22, 2024. \n\n[3] Subsection 10.1(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, [IRPA] \n\nprovides that a foreign national who seeks to enter Canada as a member of a class that is referred \n\nto in an instruction under paragraph 10.3(1)(a) may make an application only if the Minister has \n\ninvited them to do so. Ministerial Instructions applicable at the time explain the invitation process. \n\n[4] In accordance with paragraph 10.2(1)(b) of the IRPA, the Minister determines whether “the \n\nforeign national occupies the rank required to be invited to make an application and, if so, is to \n\nissue the invitation in accordance with [Ministerial] instructions given under paragraph 10.3(1)(l)”. \n\n[5] IRCC’s August 2023 letter advising the Applicant that he had been placed into the Express \n\nEntry pool made clear that there was no guarantee that he would be selected. That was by invitation \n\nonly: \n\nWhat happens next \n\nWe will rank candidates in the pool and have regular draws to \ninvite top candidates to apply for permanent residence through \none of Canada’s economic immigration programs. You must \nhave an invitation from IRCC before you can apply for \npermanent residence in these programs. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1011 (CanLII)\n\n\n\nPage: 3 \n \n\nIf you get a high score and are a top-ranked candidate in the \nExpress Entry pool, you will be considered for an invitation to \napply. If you are invited to apply, we will send you a message \nthrough your account. \n\n[Emphasis in original] \n\nLetter dated August 25, 2023, Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] \nat 94 \n\n[6] The Applicant argues that, based on his comprehensive ranking score [CRS] on the date of \n\nthe October draw, he should have been invited to apply for permanent residence. He states that the \n\nCRS had since risen and that, as a result, he has been prejudiced. \n\n[7] The fundamental flaw with the Applicant’s judicial review application is the lack of \n\nevidence. There is no evidence in the CTR about this October 2023 draw and what the requisite \n\nCRS for selection was at that time. The Applicant simply asserts that having achieved a score of \n\n511, he should have been invited to apply for permanent residence in that draw. He has not filed \n\nany evidence in support of this argument. \n\n[8] In his Application for Leave and for Judicial Review, the Applicant states that IRCC’s \n\n“decision” to refuse to issue him an invitation in October 2023 “was received on March 22, 2024”. \n\nThis means that the Applicant, or his counsel, must have received some sort of communication, \n\nnotification, or information on that date to trigger the filing of this application. However, he did \n\nnot file any evidence about this, nor was Applicant’s counsel able to provide any additional \n\ninformation at the hearing. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 1011 (CanLII)\n\n\n\nPage: 4 \n \n\n[9] This application for judicial review is based on mere assertions. In the absence of any \n\nevidence about this “decision”, the Court cannot undertake judicial review and determine whether \n\nthe Applicant’s non-selection was either procedurally unfair or unreasonable. \n\n[10] Based on the foregoing, the application for judicial review is dismissed.

Overview \n\n[1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Appeal Division \n\n[RAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated March 6, 2024 [Decision]. The RAD \n\nupheld the decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] that the Applicant is neither a \n\nConvention refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97(1) of \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] because he as an Internal \n\nFlight Alternative [IFA] in Delhi. \n\n[2] This is the second RAD appeal. The first RAD appeal was allowed, and the matter was \n\nreturned to the RPD for re-determination. Although credibility was the determinative issue at \n\ntheir first RPD hearing, at their second RPD hearing, the determinative issue was IFA. \n\n[3] For the reasons that follow, this application for judicial review is dismissed. \n\nII. Background Facts \n\n[4] Sarvjit Singh [Principal Applicant or PA], his wife, Rajwinder Kaur [Associate Applicant \n\nor AA] and their minor son, Karanvir Singh [MA] [together the “Applicants”], are citizens of \n\nIndia. Their Basis of Claim form alleges as follows. \n\n[5] The Applicants claim to fear the Punjab police who they say have falsely accused the \n\nPrincipal Applicant of working with a friend, Jagjit Johal [JJ]. JJ is an old friend who began \n\nvisiting the Principal Applicant at his store after he returned from the United Kingdom in 2016. \n\nJJ was vocal about his pro-Khalistan views and was temporarily detained by the police with \n\ninstructions to report to them when summoned. However, JJ absconded. \n\n[6] On June 7, 2017, JJ suddenly re-appeared at the PA’s store. When the police approached \n\nhim, JJ escaped. As a result, the police arrested the PA, alleging he was linked with JJ. The PA \n\nwas tortured and released on June 9th upon payment of a bribe. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\n[7] Following the release, the PA’s father received threatening phone calls. At the end of \n\nJune, police threatened to kill the PA if JJ was not located. Accordingly, the PA left his village \n\nand relocated to his sister’s home in Uttar Pradesh. He obtained the services of an agent who \n\nhelped the Applicants obtain visas for Canada. They travelled to Canada on November 26, 2017. \n\n[8] In January 2018, the AA and MA returned to India. They travelled back to Canada in \n\nMay 2018, but in August 2018, returned to India. They arrived in Canada for a third time and \n\nfinal time in July 2019. The Applicants claimed refugee protection in November 2019. \n\n[9] The first hearing before the RPD took place in April 2021. When it became apparent, the \n\nPA was having difficulty understanding and testifying, the hearing was adjourned in order to \n\ngive the Applicants an opportunity to undergo psychological testing. The PA obtained a \n\npsychological in May 2021. \n\n[10] The Applicants’ refugee hearing resumed on June 7, 2022. The RPD subsequently \n\nrejected the claims based on credibility. Although credibility was the determinative issue at their \n\nfirst RPD hearing, at their second RPD hearing the determinative issue was IFA. \n\n[11] The Applicant contests the RAD’s decision dated March 6, 2024. \n\nIII. The RAD Decision \n\n[12] The RAD held the RPD was correct in finding the Applicant has a viable IFA in Delhi. \n\nThe RAD agreed with the RAD that the determinative issue was the IFAs. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nA. New Evidence \n\n[13] The Applicants submitted as new evidence an Affidavit by a Punjabi/English translator, a \n\nreview of the audio recording of the hearing before the RPD. The translator maintained that the \n\ncorrect translation is “Khalistan” as opposed to “Sikh” person or “staunch Sikh” person as used \n\nby the interpreter during the hearing. The RAD found that the evidence, except for the second \n\npart of its paragraph 2 met the criteria for admission on appeal. \n\nB. Psychiatric Reports and Chairperson’s Guideline 8 \n\n[14] The RAD expressed being mindful of the medical evidence showing that the PA is \n\nsuffering from mental health issues such as depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and \n\nanxiety and that the AA is suffering from similar ailments. The RAD also examined the \n\nChairperson’s Guideline 8 and determined that while accommodation may be required to ensure \n\nthat vulnerable witnesses can testify in a hearing, medical evidence does not negate the \n\nrequirement that a claimant must prove their case. \n\nC. Procedural fairness \n\n[15] The Applicants argued that the RPD breached their procedural fairness rights as follows: \n\ni) they were not given a fair opportunity to present their case because the member was rude and \n\ninsensitive to the needs of the Applicants; ii) there were errors in the interpretation; and iii) the \n\nRPD was biased. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\n[16] The RAD stated that it conducted an independent review of the evidence including the \n\nwritten transcript and audio-recordings and found that the RPD did not breach the Applicant’s \n\nright to natural justice and procedural fairness. The RAD found that the Applicants were given a \n\nfair opportunity to present their case. The errors in interpretation were not material to the case. \n\nFinally, the RAD concluded that the RPD was not biased, citing that the threshold is very high to \n\nestablish bias. \n\nD. IFA \n\n(1) Punjabi police do not have the means or motivation to locate the Applicants in \nDelhi \n\n[17] The RAD applied the two-pronged test for an IFA set out in Rasaratnam v Canada \n\n(Minister of Employment and Immigration) (CA), 1991 CanLII 13517 (FCA). \n\n[18] On the first prong of the IFA test, the RAD concluded that there is no serious possibility \n\nof the Applicants being persecuted or, on a balance of probabilities, being personally subjected to \n\na risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture in the part of the country in \n\nDelhi at the hands of the Punjabi Police as they don’t have the means or motivation to locate the \n\nApplicants in Delhi. \n\n[19] The RAD found no evidence that the PA’s information would be entered into India’s \n\nCrime and Criminal Tracking Network Systems police database, thus the RAD found that the \n\nApplicants could not be located through this database. Further, there was no evidence that a \n\nsummons, an arrest warrant, or any other originating documents were produced regarding those, \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\nor any other allegations. For the RAD, this indicates that the police do not seriously consider the \n\nPA a person of interest in relation to a crime. The RAD also found that there was not sufficient \n\nevidence that the Applicants would be located through the tenant verification process. \n\n[20] The RAD also determined that the Punjab police does not have the motivation to locate \n\nthe Applicants in Delhi. The RAD considered that there was no evidence that a warrant was \n\nissued for the PA’s arrest, thus, he was able to leave the country with his own passport. This \n\ncoupled with the finding that the Punjab police were acting extrajudicially when they detained \n\nhim led to conclude that the police did not have the motivation to pursue the Applicants in Delhi \n\nsince they do not consider him to be a serious criminal (Khosla v Canada (Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 2023 FC 1557 (CanLII), at paras 52-53; Momi v Canada(Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 2023 FC 1714 (CanLII), at paras 43-45 [Momi]; Singh v Canada (Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 2023 FC 1211 (CanLII), at para 34). \n\n[21] The RAD agreed with the RPD that affidavits from 2021 from PA’s father and of the ex-\n\nsarpanch of their village do not prove the motivation of the police to locate the Applicants in \n\nDelhi in 2025. Overall, the RAD concluded that the Applicant did not prove on a balance of \n\nprobabilities that the police are motivated to the locate them in Delhi if they were to move there \n\nin 2025. \n\n[22] The RAD found that the Applicants did not prove that JJ or Khalistan militants have the \n\nmeans nor the motivation to locate them in Delhi. It found that the Applicants are speculating \n\nwhen they say that JJ will come to know that they are living there, since they have no other \n\ninformation that JJ can or will look for them anywhere. For the RAD speculation is not sufficient \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nproof, on a balance of probabilities, that JJ or his associates would be able to locate the \n\nApplicants if they are to move to Delhi. The RAD found that neither JJ nor Khalistan militants \n\nhave on the balance of probabilities the means nor motivation to locate the Applicants in Delhi. \n\n(2) It is reasonable for the Applicants to relocate to Delhi \n\n[23] On the second prong of the test, the RAD found that Delhi is a reasonable IFA. Here, the \n\nRAD noted that the Applicants must show actual concrete evidence of situations jeopardizing \n\ntheir life or safety. The RAD noted the documentary evidence indicates that Delhi has a sizable \n\nSikh community, and Punjabi is a prevalent language, that Sikhs are free to practise their \n\nreligion, and that they generally do not face systematic problems in India based on their identity. \n\n[24] Further, the RAD noted that the Associate Applicant holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree \n\nwhich will help her secure employment in Delhi. The RAD also found that the Applicants have \n\nnot established that they would be unable to access or afford ongoing treatment for their mental \n\nhealth issues in Delhi. \n\nIV. Issues and Standard of Review \n\n[25] After considering the submissions of the parties, the issues to be determined are: \n\n1. Were the RAD’s procedural fairness findings reasonable? \n\n2. Were the RAD’s conclusions on the Punjab police’s motivation and means to pursue the \nPA reasonable? \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 8 \n\n[26] The Applicants and Respondent agree that the RAD’s findings and decisions are \n\nreviewable on a reasonableness standard (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v \n\nVavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]). \n\n[27] The RAD’s findings in relation to the alleged breaches of procedural fairness by the RPD \n\nare reviewable on a reasonableness standard (Patel v Canada (MCI), 2024 FC 912 at para 13; \n\nLokhande v Canada (MCI), 2023 FC 1362 at para 7; Ayub v Canada (MCI), 2024 FC 1382 at \n\npara 14; Imafidon v Canada (MCI), 2023 FC 1592 at paras 24-25; Rodas Tejeda v Canada \n\n(MCI), 2025 FC 215 at para 47-51; Rodriguez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC \n\n774 at paras 14-20; Vavilov, at paras 23 and 25). I have therefore adopted the reasonableness \n\nstandard of review in considering both issues. \n\n[28] Reasonableness is a deferential standard of review which does not allow a reviewing \n\ncourt to reweigh evidence, interfere with a decision maker’s factual findings or substitute the \n\nconclusion that the court would have reached in the shoes of the decision maker (Vavilov at \n\nparas 15, 125). A reasonableness review is a robust form of review that requires the Court to \n\nconsider both the administrator’s decision-making process and the outcome of the decision \n\n(Vavilov at paras 83, 87; Mason v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at \n\npara 58 [Mason]). \n\n[29] A reviewing court must consider the reasonableness of the decision as a whole, \n\nconsidering both its outcome and the decision maker’s underlying rationale (Vavilov at paras 15, \n\n83). A reasonable decision is based on a rational and logical chain of analysis and is justified, \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 9 \n\ntransparent and intelligible in light of the factual and legal constraints bearing upon it (Vavilov at \n\nparas 99, 102, 105). The onus is on the Applicant to demonstrate the unreasonableness of the \n\ndecision (Vavilov at para 100). A decision will be unreasonable where there are shortcomings in \n\nthe decision that are sufficiently central or significant (Vavilov at para 100). If the reasons of the \n\ndecision-maker allow a reviewing court to understand why the decision was made and determine \n\nwhether the decision falls within a range of acceptable outcomes, the decision will be reasonable \n\n(Vavilov at paras 85-86). \n\nV. Submissions \n\nA. Applicants’ submissions \n\n(1) Procedural Fairness \n\n[30] The Applicants submit that the RAD’s determination that they were given a fair \n\nopportunity to present their case before the RPD was unreasonable. \n\n[31] The Applicants argue there were issues understanding and answering questions during \n\nthe hearing. They believe it was procedurally unfair and contrary to the psychological report \n\nwhich recommended that the AA be allowed to answer questions for the PA. The Applicants \n\nargue that the PA was questioned in contravention with the psychologist’s recommendations. \n\nThey also believe the RPD failed to afford them necessary empathy and patience. In support of \n\ntheir assertions of the breach of procedural fairness, the Applicants rely on the following case \n\nlaw: Ozturk v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1219 (CanLII) at paragraph 13; \n\nWarsame v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 118 (CanLII) at paragraph 32. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 10 \n\n(2) Reasonableness  \n\n[32] According to the Applicants’ submissions, the RAD’s conclusions on the Punjab Police’s \n\nmotivation to pursue and its means to locate the PA in the proposed IFA are unreasonable for \n\nseveral reasons. \n\n[33] With respect to there being a lack of evidence of the police’s ongoing interest in the \n\nApplicants since 2021, they argue that the RAD ignored their evidence. They argue that PA’s \n\nfather, who had previously written an affidavit in 2021 attesting to the police’s continued \n\ninquiries after the PA, passed away on May 15, 2023, and consequently could not provide an \n\nupdated affidavit. The Applicants submit that the RAD gave no consideration to PA’s testimony \n\nin the August 2023 hearing before the RPD stating that he gets information from family \n\nmembers, a shopkeeper and the Sarpanch. For the Applicants, the RAD ignored evidence that ran \n\ncontrary to their central conclusion on police motivation, which a reviewable error. \n\n[34] The Applicants also argue that RAD’s assessment of the police’s motivation to pursue the \n\nPA to the proposed IFA did not include a consideration of how the PA’s profile in the eyes of the \n\npolice had changed since he left for Canada. While previously the police had only been \n\ninterested in the PA because of his ability to aid their search for JJ, after he fled to Canada, the \n\nevidence shows that the police’s accusations against the PA evolved to include allegations that \n\nhe is living together with JJ and “had become antinational.” For the Applicants, the fact that \n\nthere is no evidence that the Punjab police have searched for the PA outside of his home village \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 11 \n\nis not evidence that they would be unmotivated to do so should he return to the country, since \n\nperceived militants and supporters of Khalistan are high profile in India. \n\n[35] Another argument presented by the Applicants is that the RAD’s conclusion on the \n\nPunjab police’s means to locate the PA in the proposed IFA was unreasonable because the PA \n\ngave his biometrics to the Punjab police, and it is more likely than not that some sort of record on \n\nhim exists. As such, he could be tracked should he return to India. Further, the Applicants submit \n\nthat there is evidence that the Punjab police were also making inquiries about the PA to his \n\nfamily and fellow villagers. Finally, given the PA’s heightened profile as a perceived \n\nantinational that authorities in India take militancy and other threats to national security \n\nseriously, and that they have extensive powers to deal with individuals who are suspected of \n\nbeing involved with separatist movements, it would be reasonable to conclude that the Punjab \n\npolice would have the resources to pursue the PA to the proposed IFA, should he return to India. \n\nB. Respondent’s submissions \n\n(1) Procedural Fairness \n\n[36] The Respondent submits that the Applicants had a fair opportunity to present their case. \n\nRegarding the allegation that the RPD was rude and insensitive, the RAD acknowledged that the \n\nhearing was at times challenging and charged but did not deprive the Applicants of an \n\nopportunity to present their case. The Respondent gave the following examples from the \n\ntranscript where the RPD Member acknowledged the psychological report and was kind towards \n\nthe Applicants as referenced by the Respondent: \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 12 \n\nMEMBER: Okay. So, Madame KAUR, at --- at this moment, it's \nyour husband who's the Designated Representative of your son; \nhowever, after reading the psychological report, the psychologist \nsuggested that you would be in a better position to testify about \nwhat happened. So, when --- when it comes to the questioning part, \nI'm going to start by questioning you. So, in light of the \npsychological report, I just had a discussion with your Counsel and \nwe both agree that it would be better if you were the Designated \nRepresentative to your son because you're again, you're the one \nwho is in a better position to testify and a Designated \nRepresentative, what their main responsibility is --- is to put forth \nthat the interests of the Claimant in --- in --- in this sense, your son. \nSo, would you be willing to be Designated Representative of your \nson? Did she say anything? Does she understand the question? \n\nMEMBER: And if you require a break at any time during the \nhearing, say so and we can break for a few minutes. \n\n[37] The Respondent submits that the RAD’s findings are consistent with the record, which \n\nshows that the RPD Member made several procedural accommodations based on the \n\npsychological report and counsel’s own suggestions. The Respondent also points out that the \n\nApplicants selected certain extracts of the transcript to bolster their argument while failing to \n\nproduce the context of the extracts. \n\n(2) The Applicants have a viable IFA in India \n\n[38] The Respondent submits that the Applicants did not displace the onus under the first \n\nprong of the IFA test. The Respondent cites Momi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n\n2023 FC 1714 to support that the RAD reasonably considered that the Applicants left India on \n\ntheir own passports despite the police’s broad powers to stop them from doing so due to the \n\nseriousness with which they treat militancy support, and that there is no evidence they are \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 13 \n\nwanted by police. Importantly, the Applicants did not adduce any recent evidence that the Punjab \n\npolice continued to pursue them. \n\n[39] The Respondent considers the argument that the RAD failed to consider that PA’s risk \n\nprofile puts him at heightened risk lacks merit. The Respondent notes that the PA did not make \n\nany arguments before the RAD that the Punjab police’s accusation that he now lives with JJ \n\nheightens his risk profile. For the Respondent, this does not displace the finding that the \n\nApplicants did not adduce any objective evidence, such as a summons or warrant that would \n\nindicate the PA is considered to be anti-national and thus at heightened risk. As the RAD noted \n\nat paragraphs 38-39, the Applicant’s interactions with police do not indicate a genuine belief he \n\nis perceived as an anti-nationalist. Having failed to establish the Punjab police genuinely suspect \n\nthe Applicant’s involvement in anti-national activities, it was reasonable for the RAD to find \n\ninsufficient evidence they remain motivated to pursue him in the IFA. \n\nVI. Analysis \n\nA. Procedural Fairness \n\n[40] I find the RAD did consider the Applicants’ procedural fairness arguments and \n\nreasonably concluded they had a fair opportunity to present their case. I respectfully agree with \n\nthe Respondent that the Applicants allegations that the RPD member was rude and insensitive \n\nwere examined by the RAD. The RAD recognized in its reasons that the hearing was at times \n\nchallenging and charged but did not deprive the Applicants of the opportunity to present their \n\ncase. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 14 \n\n[41] Upon an attentive reading of the transcripts of the hearing before the RPD, the Member \n\ncarefully considered the psychological reports and adapted the questioning based on suggestions \n\nfrom the Applicants’ counsel. \n\n[42] Also, as pointed out by the Respondent, the RAD took in consideration and listed several \n\nprocedural accommodations that were taken by the RPD including allowing the AA to \n\ncommence giving evidence, providing water breaks, agreeing to a break when counsel suggested \n\none; agreeing to counsel’s suggestion that the PA start to give evidence after the break; asking \n\nPA if it would be okay for the RPD to ask him some questions, which he confirmed was okay. \n\n[43] The RAD’s analysis also took in consideration the fact that the RPD member asked the \n\nApplicants to speak up on several occasions since they often spoke so quietly, the audio was not \n\npicking up the sound, and that the RPD kept the psychological assessment in mind throughout \n\nthe hearing while attempting to meet its obligations to assess the refugee claim. \n\n[44] Considering the above, I find that it was reasonable for the RAD to conclude the \n\nApplicants had a fair opportunity to present their case. \n\nB. Reasonableness of the IFA decision \n\n[45] On the first prong of the IFA analysis, a claimant bears the onus of demonstrating that the \n\nproposed IFA is unreasonable because they fear a serious possibility of persecution throughout \n\ntheir entire country, including, of course, in the proposed IFAs. In order to discharge their \n\nburden, the claimant must demonstrate that they will remain at risk in the proposed IFA from the \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 15 \n\nsame individual or agents of persecution that originally put them at risk. This assessment is a \n\nprospective analysis and is considered from the perspective of the agents of persecution, not \n\nfrom the perspective of the claimant (see Vartia v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 \n\nFC 1426 at para 29, citing Adeleye v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 81 at \n\npara 21 and Aragon Caicedo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 485 at para 12). \n\n[46] The Applicants were required to show that the agents of persecution would be motivated \n\nto find them in the IFA. As pointed out by the Respondent, the evidence on record is that the \n\nPA’s family, neighbour, and Sarpanch interactions with the Punjab police have been local. The \n\naffidavit from the PA’s father indicates the risks are in Punjab, India, but is silent on the potential \n\nrisks outside of Punjab. \n\n[47] There is no evidence that Punjab police have followed through on the threat to make false \n\ncharges against the PA, or entered his information into a national database, nor did the \n\nApplicants adduce any objective evidence, such as a summons, or warrants indicating that he is \n\nconsidered to be anti-national and thus at a heightened risk. I agree with the Respondent that his \n\ninteractions with police do not indicate a genuine belief he is perceived as an anti-nationalist, nor \n\nthat he his involved in anti-national activities. \n\n[48] The jurisprudence of this Court has found that extrajudicial arrests and the lack of any \n\ncharges can reasonably lead to the inference that the police lack the motivation to pursue an \n\napplicant in the IFA location and that the lack of official documentation such as an arrest warrant \n\nor summons reasonably can lead to the conclusion that the Punjab police do not genuinely \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 16 \n\nsuspect someone of a serious crime (Athwal v Canada (MCI), 2024 FC 672 at para 32; Momi at \n\npara 43 and Khosla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 1557 at para 52). \n\n[49] Furthermore, in this case, the Applicants were able to leave India on their own passports \n\ndespite the police’s broad powers to stop them from doing so due to the seriousness with which \n\nthey treat militancy support, and that there is no evidence they are wanted by police. (Momi at \n\nparas 37- 42.) \n\n[50] Overall, I find that the RAD completed a thorough analysis that took into consideration \n\nthe evidence on file, the Applicants’ testimonies and the documentary evidence. There is no error \n\nin its analysis. \n\nVII. Conclusion \n\n[51] I find that the Applicants have not met their burden to establish that the RAD Decision is \n\nunreasonable, nor that any breach of procedural fairness occurred. \n\n[52] The application for judicial review is dismissed. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 993 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 17 \n\nJUDGMENT in IMM-5402-24 \n\nTHIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that: \n\n1.

The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] dismissed his claim because he \n\ndid not establish his identity, and the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] confirmed this finding on \n\nappeal. On judicial review, the Applicant alleges that the RAD’s decision is unreasonable \n\n \n\n2025 FC 996 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 2 \n\nbecause it set aside his evidence or was otherwise unconvinced by it. I disagree. For the \n\nfollowing reasons, this application is dismissed. \n\n[2] The sole issue is whether the decision under review is reasonable (Canada (Minister of \n\nCitizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at paras 10, 25 [Vavilov]; Mason v \n\nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at paras 7, 39–44 [Mason]). To avoid \n\njudicial intervention, the decision must bear the hallmarks of reasonableness—justification, \n\ntransparency, and intelligibility (Vavilov at para 99; Mason at para 59). A decision may be \n\nunreasonable if the decision maker misapprehended the evidence before it (Vavilov at paras 125–\n\n126; Mason at para 73). Reasonableness review is not a “rubber-stamping” exercise, it is a robust \n\nform of review (Vavilov at para 13; Mason at para 63). The party challenging the decision bears \n\nthe onus of demonstrating that the decision is unreasonable (Vavilov at para 100). \n\n[3] Absent exceptional circumstances, the Court’s role on judicial review does not involve \n\n“reweighing and reassessing the evidence considered by the decision maker” (Vavilov at para \n\n125, citing Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 \n\nSCC 31 at para 55). The RAD is tasked with carrying out its own analysis of the record, either \n\nconfirming the RPD decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination of the \n\nmerits of the refugee claim (Huruglica v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 93 at \n\npara 103). \n\n[4] Refugee applicants are presumed to tell the truth, but that presumption is challengeable, \n\nand a lack of credibility may suffice to refute it (Lawani v Canada (Citizenship and \n\n \n\n2025 FC 996 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 3 \n\nImmigration), 2018 FC 924 at para 21). The presumption is notably rebuttable where the \n\nevidence is inconsistent with the applicant’s sworn testimony (Su v Canada (Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 2015 FC 666 at para 11, citing Adu v Canada (Minister of Employment and \n\nImmigration), [1995] FCJ No 114 (QL) (FCA)), or where the decision maker is unsatisfied with \n\nthe applicant’s explanation for those inconsistencies (Lin v Canada (Citizenship and \n\nImmigration), 2010 FC 183 at para 19). \n\n[5] The Applicant argues that the decision under review provides “no valid reasons” for \n\nsetting his evidence aside, and that the RAD “does not appear to have [given] any weight” to the \n\nevidence he submitted in support of his claim (Applicant’s Memorandum at paras 3, 4, 9, 23). In \n\nso doing, he is essentially asking this Court to interfere with the RAD’s factual findings. I see no \n\nreason to do so. \n\n[6] The RAD concluded that the Applicant was not sufficiently credible to establish his \n\nidentity and that some of his documents were fraudulent, rebutting the presumptions of veracity \n\nassociated with each component of his evidence (see Maldonado v Canada (Minister of \n\nEmployment and Immigration), [1980] 2 FC 302, 1979 CanLII 4098 (FCA) at para 5; \n\nRamalingam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 7241 (FC) at \n\npara 5). \n\n[7] A central issue was the Applicant’s failure to provide a Bangladeshi passport to establish \n\nhis identity, since he entered Canada on an Indian passport, and never obtained a Bangladeshi \n\ntravel document out of an alleged fear of being located (RAD Reasons at para 13). However, he \n\n \n\n2025 FC 996 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 4 \n\nlater testified that his father went to several offices and arranged to secure documents in \n\nBangladesh to prove his identity (RAD Reasons at para 14). Both the RAD and RPD found this \n\nto be a serious contradiction with respect to the Applicant’s alleged fear of the Bangladeshi \n\ngovernment, and I see no reason to interfere with that finding. \n\n[8] The RAD noted further problems with the Applicant’s evidence. It found issues with his \n\nbirth certificate, observed a discrepancy between his testimony and his marriage certificate, \n\nseveral discrepancies within the testimony itself, deemed his license and identity card to be \n\ncounterfeit, and pointed to documentary evidence on the prevalence of fraudulent identity \n\ndocuments in Bangladesh (RAD Reasons at paras 19–32). \n\n[9] The prevalence of inauthentic documents in Bangladesh does not relieve the RPD and \n\nRAD of the duty to determine whether the Applicant’s particular documents are genuine (Chen v \n\nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1133 at para 10), but this duty was not \n\neschewed in this case. The inauthenticity findings did not rely solely on documentary evidence, \n\nbut on the inconsistencies within the documents themselves: the Minister found no matching \n\nbirth records with his birth certificate (RAD Reasons at paras 19–21); the location on his \n\nmarriage certificate did not match his testimony (RAD Reasons at paras 22–24); the national \n\nidentity card used commercial inks (RAD Reasons at paras 25–28). Simply put, the RAD made \n\nintelligible, transparent, and justified findings of fact in light of the evidence and submissions \n\npresented to it (Vavilov at paras 105, 125–128). These findings were not unreasonable based on \n\nthe evidentiary record before the RAD. The Applicant’s argument that the RAD provided “no \n\nvalid reasons” for setting his evidence aside is without merit. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 996 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 5 \n\n[10] Moreover, contradictory statements can be considered in the overall assessment of a \n\nclaimant’s credibility (Sun v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 477 at para 38, \n\nciting Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v Dan-Ash, 1988 CanLII 10307 \n\n(FCA), [1988] FCJ No 571 (QL), 93 NR 33 (CA)). The role of this Court does not involve \n\nconducting such a re-assessment of the evidence, nor does it involve reweighing the evidence \n\npresented before the RAD, absent exceptional circumstances (see, generally, Safe Food Matters \n\nInc v Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 19 at paras 37–39, and the authorities cited therein). \n\n[11] In this case, the RAD was plainly entitled to make the findings of fact it made and draw a \n\nnegative credibility inference from them. The Applicant disagrees with these findings but has not \n\nshown why they are unreasonable. Accordingly, I cannot intervene. \n\n[12] I pause to observe a small evidentiary issue in this case. Before the RAD, the Applicant \n\nclaimed that he filed new and relevant evidence that would have favoured his case, although \n\nthere is no proof that such evidence was indeed submitted (RAD Reasons at paras 7–9). He \n\nrepeated this claim before the Court on judicial review, insisting that the evidence was in fact put \n\nbefore the RAD. However, in a letter post-dating the Federal Court hearing, the Applicant now \n\nacknowledges that he was mistaken, and that the evidence was not available to the RAD. In this \n\nsame letter, he nevertheless urges the Court to take this new evidence into account. \n\n[13] Parliament has entrusted the RAD with the assessment and evaluation of the evidence on \n\nthe merits of refugee claims, and I would be remiss “to overlook the loss of the benefit of the \n\ntribunal’s views inherent in allowing the issue to be raised” (Alberta (Information and Privacy \n\n \n\n2025 FC 996 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 6 \n\nCommissioner) v Alberta Teachers’ Association, 2011 SCC 61 at para 25). No exception to the \n\ngeneral rule against admitting new evidence on judicial review applies here (Bernard v Canada \n\n(Revenue Agency), 2015 FCA 263 at paras 13–28). \n\n[14] Nevertheless, even if I had accepted to introduce the new evidence in the record, that \n\nevidence is not sufficiently persuasive and does not rebut the factual findings of the RAD \n\nrelating to the contradictions noted above. Identity is an essential component of any refugee \n\nclaim, and the failure to prove it is fatal (Edobor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 \n\nFC 1064 at para 8). The new evidence adduced consists in unsworn statements from individuals \n\nwho are currently in Canada. The evidence demonstrates that some individuals met the Applicant \n\nin Bangladesh in 2014, while others simply state knowing the Applicant and him being \n\nBangladeshi by birth and a genuine citizen, without providing any additional information or \n\nparticulars to establish that fact. That unsworn evidence does not constitute reliable and \n\npersuasive evidence that is sufficient to rebut the factual findings of the RAD. \n\n[15] For the reasons set out above, this application for judicial review is dismissed. There is \n\nno question of general importance to certify. \n\n \n\n2025 FC 996 (CanLII)\n\n\n\n Page: 7 \n\nJUDGMENT in IMM-5272-24 \n\nTHIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that: \n\n1.
